Since then, Redux eclipsed the classic Flux in popularity, found converts in React, Angular, and Meteor communities, and spawned a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. In this talk, Dan reflects on the past, present, and future of Redux.",

    "description": "Animations are one of the most important elements of modern, well-crafted mobile apps. Animation effects possible to achieve using native SDKs exceed by far the capabilities of mobile browsers, hence based on the quality of animations it is easy to tell the difference between truly native apps and ones that run in a webview. React Native provides several APIs for handling animations (layout animations, native navigator, Animated.js library). Some of them lets you directly leverage native SDK capabilities, others require round-trips over native-to-JS bridge. We will dive a little into implementation details of each of those methods to explain their limitations. I will also discuss native-animated-driver (the project I've been recently working on), and give some tips on how to make your React-Native app stay at 60FPS.",

Redux allows us to maintain our application state in a single store, and provides a single location for state changes. By hooking analytics into this event loop we can infer a lot about end user behaviour. Our Redux Segment middleware allows you to draw deep and rich analytics from your Redux application with minimal configuration. In this talk, we will walk through the process of adding analytics to your existing Redux application and share our implementation which works with segment.io.",

The functionality that li.st provides covers a wide range of common patterns that you'll find in most apps, which is one of the reasons why we wanted to build it in the first place: to test the limits of Exponent and React Native with in real world scenarios. Living on the edge with both React Native and Exponent, you'd be right to guess that we ran into our fair share of problems.

    "description": "Michael Chan at react-europe 2015.\n\nReact allows you to write styles inline and bypass a host of CSS shortcomings. Scope, dependency management, dead code elimination, these problems go away when adding your styles directly to components. But it's not all rainbows and unicorns. Things like theming and media queries become much more difficult when all your styles live directly on components. In this talk, we'll look at how to solve these problems with contexts and plain old JavaScript. We'll also look at the role of container-components and when it's better to \"just use CSS.\"",

    "description": "Get next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/#tickets\n\nReact has a long and storied past of abstracting away state management. First it was mixins, then HOCs killed mixins, then render props killed HOCs, and now hooks have killed render props. Or have they? There is still some value that render props can provide that hooks cannot. This talk explores that use case so that you can learn to recognize the scenario and deploy render props intelligently.\n\nFollow Erik here https://twitter.com/erikras\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/#tickets",

How can front end developers advocate for the strengths of the mobile web, and build experiences so good that it’s not always necessary to point the user to a native app?

Yet, what if there was still a way?\n\nLet's investigate together what can be improved and added to our test strategies to make them even more reliable thanks to property based testing. But contrary to classical talk around property based testing, we are going to go further by extending it to user interfaces and race conditions detection.\n\nBy the end of this talk, our CI will have been turned into an automated QA identifying issues in our UI.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/#tickets",

It builds on Next.js and adds a new invisible data layer that removes the need to build your own API.

This is illustrated by introducing the notion of local state presented via a series of examples. State is changed by means of reducers, that can operate directly on the current component, or on distant components via remote actions. Further examples illustrate how certain animations can be considered instances of local state that can be easily composed.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

But React is so much more! Its architecture, designed to separate the DOM-specific fragments from the library core, makes it suitable for many other types of applications. In fact, React Native itself leverages these capabilities though its custom renderer that, instead of working with the DOM, manipulates native OS primitives.​ ​But how do those renderers work exactly? Can anyone write one? What makes them a better choice than, say, a regular template language? Are they limited to UI work? We'll discuss all that, and take a quick tour of the existing renderers made those past years.",

Blazing fast! But how much can you actually do with a static site. ANYTHING! In this talk we will look at how Gatsby can be used to build highly dynamic content - such as gated/authenticated content - without breaking the JAMstack workflow.\n\nThis talk will begin with a brief introduction to Gatsby and the JAMstack, detailing the performance benefits and unique problems that surface with static content. The main focus of the talk will be around dynamically building an authenticated API from markdown files at build time - keeping our workflow consistent for both public and protected content. This style of development would also allow all content to be tracked by git and easily rolled back.",

    "description": "Get next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html\n\nWriting UI that can be accurately translated often comes with tradeoffs. If the text is sufficiently complicated, engineers have to take great pains (write conditionals, which are often error-prone) to ensure it is accurately rendered in other languages. Additionally, engineers are often either required to (a) keep strings separate from UI, or (b) keep translatable text simple enough to be extracted from UI source.\n\nFbt is an explicit markup language that tackles complexity and keeps UI text bundled with the relevant source code. This has the added benefit of keeping UI source self-documenting. This markup is parsed at build-time with text collected and sent to translators. The framework enables engineers to write text that would normally be tedious and error-prone in a succinct and accurate way.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html",

Most of web ecosystem tackled this subject years ago (Rails, Symfony, …), however, what about the JavaScript (especially SPA) ecosystem?\n\nWhile most of current solutions (redux-form, Formik) provides full-features and widely used solutions, we are gonna focus on “typed forms”.\n\nIn a JavaScript ecosystem being more and more “typed” with the expansion of both GraphQL and TypeScript, why not take advantages of typed data? “Typed-data” means, no more duplicated logic between the back-end and the front-end (fields list, validation, etc).\n\nWe will explore an alternative way to manage forms using types and GraphQL.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html",

    "description": "At Twitter, teams have starting adopting React because it’s enabled UI engineers to forget about time when writing rendering code. And we've started exploring similar simplifications in the data layer, embracing the UI’s role as part of a distributed system. First, we'll share how user experience choices are a primary influence on how we design the data layer, especially for teams developing new products with full-stack capabilities. Working with data from multiple backend services has powerful benefits, and shapes the problem space for UI engineering. Next, we'll look at how React and Flux approaches can help in our problem scenarios. Yet even after the advances in React’s component model, the data layer is still an important source of complexity as an app grows and changes over time. Finally, we'll look at new approaches we’ve been exploring, and how designs like decoupling 'recording facts' from 'computing views of those facts' have influenced UI engineering. These designs nudge teams towards simplicity when creating impactful user-facing improvements like real-time updates, optimistic commits, and graceful handling of network outages.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/krob",

    "description": "React.js is changing the way developers think about mobile app development, especially with the recent announcement of React Native. However, in many ways hybrid (web + mobile) app development is here to stay for a large number of mobile apps. Everyone's heard \"you can't build a native experience in a web view\". We disagree. You just have to know the right tricks. And when you do, the web becomes an incredibly powerful platform for delivering amazing user experience using the technology you know. At Thinkmill in Sydney, over the course of developing several commercial apps, we've experienced the power of using ReactJS for mobile apps built on web technology, and developed a framework we call TouchstoneJS (which Tom Occhino called \"the best looking and feeling implementation of this that I've seen\" during the Q&A session at React Conf) to share this capability with developers around the world. In this talk I'll share what we've learned and how we've approached the unique challenges of mobile web apps - with tools that are useful to all developers building touch interfaces with React, as well as a walkthrough of our development process and framework. I'll also talk about what you can do with the web platform that you can't with native apps, and even React Native.",

Is it possible to create a transparent reactive, snapshotable state container. With support for JSON patches, replayable actions, serialization, complex object graphs. With Redux & MobX compatibility, strong typing and runtime type checks out of the box. Get a glimpse of what next-gen state management might look like with mobx-state-tree.

    "description": "With the advent of libraries like React, Redux and Immutable.js, it’s clear that there’s a shift away from imperative and object-oriented in the front-end towards a more declarative and functional approach. Meanwhile, libraries like RxJS and Mobx are spreading the use of Reactive Programming to model UIs via discrete, asynchronous event streams. How can we combine the best of both functional and reactive paradigms to model and build predictable UIs that control themselves?\nIn this talk, Preethi will explain what “Functional Reactive Programming” is, how close React / Redux / Mobx / RxJs and others come in realizing Functional Reactive Programming, and what’s still fundamentally missing from these tools to achieve a true implementation of FRP. Lastly, she’ll describe when and why FRP is suitable (or not suitable) for building predictable and scalable UIs.",

It can aid and reinforce spatial maps of our interfaces, and give us a sense that we understand interactions more deeply. For this reason, animation is incredibly powerful to convey meaning, but only when done well.\nBut animating the virtual DOM comes with some intricacies that affect our implementations. In this talk, we’ll go over animating in React with a variety of methods, comparing and contrasting each. We’ll cover add-ons like ReactCSSTransitionGroup, using external libraries like GSAP, React-Motion, motion using RxJS, and transitioning state with D3. We’ll look inside some real systems, breaking down how we can create reusable components of animation principles for interchangeable yet cohesive patterns.",

But after 20 years of success in the music industry including signing acts like Pendulum and Chase and Status to his label Breakbeat Kaos and having the UK’s first ever Drum & Bass and Dubstep Number 1 records, Dan Stein contracted cancer, and after a narrow brush with death realised that he needed a change of pace. In 2017, he attended a Ruby boot-camp and two years later is a Machine Learning Developer at leading education research company HT2 Labs in Oxford, where his work has helped to win innovation awards. Stein believes that as our lives become more and more intertwined with technology that there are roles for everyone to be passionate about in the world of Tech. He’s here to tell us his story and explain why he thinks that developers are ‘Hot Right Now’.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html",

GraphQL optimizes data fetches and mutations. Adding mobx-state-tree to this mix, makes this model even richer: It allows client only state, actions and derived data to be mixed into our data models. We can go even further and mix in different behavior for different types of clients, while still using our GraphQL models as source of truth. Finally we can have the best of both worlds: straightforward data propagation, over the network and in the client.

We launched Croatian in May with little overhead beyond setting up the new domain and translating phrases. However, this was not true for all new languages; our next most requested language, Hebrew, posed a unique challenge. Because it reads right-to-left, the entire Hebrew UI must be flipped. Browsers only handle reversing the DOM structure, but styling and interactions must be coded manually.\n\nThis talk covers the journey of enabling right-to-left languages on airbnb.com. Recently, Airbnb has moved to a React frontend and away from Sass to a CSS-in-JS paradigm. We developed a performant and cross-browser solution for RTL that leveraged a CSS-in-JS abstraction layer to isolate the logic from our codebase. Our efforts led us most of the way to launching in Arabic and Hebrew while requiring little effort from our product engineers and with minimal disruption to their work.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

But runtime type systems can do many more things than just data validation. Because they are very flexible (as you can basically reuse the entire hosting language to express your types) it will be much less likely that you will run into structures that cannot be expressed in the type system. You can generate runtime types on the fly from other sources (json-schema, graphql etc) or compose them together.\n\nIn this talk I will walk you through some runtime type systems, like prop-types, tcomb and mobx-state-tree. But also show you how runtime- and compile-time type systems like TypeScript or Flow can co-exist and leverage each other.\n\nIf you thought so far Higher Order Components or render callbacks where cool, in this talk I will show you that these patterns can be applied in general to any data structure you have.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

    "description": "Get notified of next edition's tickets here: https://goo.gl/zfEhBp\n\nLet’s play a game. What’s the biggest difference between type systems for JavaScript and an ML inspired language like OCaml or Haskell? Subtyping! Subtyping allows runtime values of some type to be used as a different type, and how a language designer chooses to address subtyping deeply affects every other design decision in the language. From the way values are represented in the runtime, to how effective type inference algorithms are, to the supported polymorphic code patterns. Implicit runtime subtyping is common in today’s most popular languages like JavaScript, Java, C#, and Ruby but the tradeoffs aren’t well understood. Subtyping is useful, but in today’s programming environment subtyping is overrated.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/zfEhBp",

    "description": "Abstract:\nOne of the things I love about React is how easy it is to encapsulate UI code into a component. I love this because it makes reuse of those components easy. But is it simple? I've made my fair share of components that had to accept a bunch of props to handle a growing list of different use cases resulting in a complex render function full of conditional statements and a confusing API for people using this \"reusable\" component. Eventually it becomes too much and I had to make a new version of the same component to handle slightly different use cases. Lots of code/bug duplication there because my reusable component wasn't reusable enough. It wasn't simple enough.\n\n\nThere are patterns that have emerged in React that allow you to promote code reuse without sacrificing the simplicity or flexibility of the component. In this talk we’ll cover some of these patterns that will make your React components more useful.",

It's handy, it's familiar, it kinda works, but maybe you've thought \"this could be better.\" And you're right: it can be. In this talk, you'll meet Reactotron, a free, open-source development tool for your React and React Native projects. You'll see how just a few lines of code will give you access to a world of useful information about what's going in your app. Get better stack traces on errors, peer into the gory details of your network requests, pry open your async storage, subscribe to Redux store changes, debug your sagas, and the list goes on. By the end, you'll be ready to start working with Reactotron in your own projects, and wonder how you ever worked without it.",

But since Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are getting more popular, web developers and designers now have a serious reason to get to know the 3D web, its APIs and design patterns.\nIn this talk you will learn how to create 3D applications in the browser, using ReactJS in combination with popular VR libraries, like A-Frame and ReactVR. You will also see what is necessary to create a Virtual Reality app that runs on common VR devices, and how to create Augmented Reality applications for Android and iOS phones.\nSince 3D user interfaces and interactions in the browser are relatively new for designers and users, there are no established UX design patterns yet, but you will get to know best-practices and see some tips for improving the usability of your 3d application.\nThe talk ends with my advice on how to create responsible applications, that won’t harm your users – neither physically nor psychologically.",

At the end of this talk, you will go home with practices you can apply to your projects and feel more confident doing so. 🚀\n\nhttp://bit.ly/a11y-react-native",

From profile screens to login pages, forms are unavoidable, and let’s be honest, they’re not very fun to build. For each field, you need to hold the value in the state of your component, implement onChange and onBlur handlers, implement validation… that makes for a lot of boilerplate, and that’s just for simple inputs. \nThere are several libraries out there that attempt to simplify this process, from Redux Form, to React Form, to Formik, among others.

    "description": "PayPal Checkout with React Native by Poornima Venkatakrishnan of PayPal\n\nTalk Abstract\nThis talk is a technical deep-dive of how we use react-native as a means to deliver Checkout experience in our open sourced Paypal SDK. It will also layout how react-native has given us the power to steer without merchants having to reintegrate and republish with every incremental SDK release.\nTalk Description\nWhy ?\n‘Pay with Paypal’ is an option many of us use while shopping online . While Paypal has a solid web experience, we are still experimenting a good solve for the mobile ecosystem. Since we aim for stellar experiences we will need to iterate and learn quickly by A/B testing. But at the same time we need to be mindful of not having to force our merchants to continuously upgrade Paypal SDKs and publish updates on the app store. After some research/ investigation into options, we decided to build our SDK using react-native.\nHow ?\nThe SDK will be a native shell which will place a react-native root view into the Merchants View Controller that is initializing the Paypal SDK. This root view acts as a seed to initialize Paypal experiences. Whenever the react root view is initialized, we will pull down a checkout react-native bundle from the cloud which will host the payment experience within. When the SDK detects that a Paypal payment is initiated, the react-native layer is informed and it hosts the appropriate experience to complete the Payment (either opens a SFVC with the right mobile optimized web experience or natively put up a Paypal Pay sheet modal). Once the Payment is complete we close out the react-native hosted experience and the native shell places the merchant app in the right state, post payment. By this, we could sandbox and control the Paypal payment experience we host within the react-native layer, without interfering with the merchant app’s workflow. And the Paypal SDK integration will be a one-time easy process for the merchants !\nNotes\nStatus of the Mobile Paypal Checkout SDK\nThis is an ongoing R & D project and we have our initial open sourced SDKs here. The plan is to iterate on experiences independent of our merchants on-boarding process to integrate into the SDKs. We are actively working with merchants to onboard them onto this.\nhttps://github.com/paypal/paypalnativecheckout-docs https://github.com/paypal/paypalcheckout-ios https://github.com/paypal/paypalcheckout-android",

    "description": "React + ES.Next by Ben Ilegbodu of Eventbrite\n\nTalk Abstract\nDiscover how to leverage the new JavaScript language features and apply them to our React Native project.\nTalk Description\nJavaScript is evolving quickly. The ES6 specification was released back in 2015 and has been implemented by modern browsers. New versions of ECMAScript will now be released on a yearly basis. We can leverage ES6 and functionality slated for future versions right now to write even clearer and more concise React code.\nExperience with React will help you get the most out of this session, but you don’t have to have a JavaScript black belt to leave feeling confident in using ES.next with React. Learn how to write cleaner code using the new spread operator, classes, modules, destructuring, and other tasty syntactic sugar features being introduced into ECMAScript. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t understand all of those terms — you soon will after this session!\nNotes\nThe goal of this talk is to walk React / React Native developers who aren’t familiar with new ECMAScript through some of its cool new features (including proposed new ones). But it’s more than just learning ES6+. It’s about how we can apply it (as well as future versions of ECMAScript) with React to write clearer and more succinct code. We’ll start off with React’s previous official tutorial that is 100% ES5 and slowly transform it using various ES6 and proposed future ECMAScript features that are transpiled via Babel. I developed a Github repo that is a step-by-step example of how to leverage ES6+/ES2015+ in React by rewriting (an adapted version of) the official React tutorial.\nECMAScript 2015 is JavaScript. React added support for native ES6 classes over a year ago (with v0.13), but there is still lots of developers still writing in ES5. Many coding examples and StackOverflow answers are given in ES6 so it’s important for us in the React community to level up.\nOutline:\nQuick React explanation\nQuick ECMAScript explanation\nModules\nClasses\nDestructuring\nArray + object spread (object.assign)\nObject rest parameters\nArrow functions\nBlock scoping (Let & const)\nPromise (w/ fetch api)\nComputed object literal properties with class names\nArray api additions\nDefault parameters",

There’s a deeper level than Touchable* components and PanResponders. Kyle and Thomas will uncover it, and show off its full potential!\nTalk Description\nTouchable* components and PanResponder add the magic of touch to your React Native app. They are great for building basic interactions, but to build more complex ones, we need a deeper understanding of how gestures work in React Native.\nThis talk peels back the layers of React Native’s gesture system, from higher level abstractions like Touchable*, to PanResponder, and finally to the thing powering it all: the Responder system. We’ll go through some of the more simple gestures, then showcase the full potential with custom ones, including bubbling and capture from multiple components. And with our demo app, the audience will be able to interact along with us. When attendees leave our session, they’ll feel empowered, not intimidated, by the many configuration options in (Pan)Responder. Equipped with a deeper understanding of gestures in React Native, they’ll be able to build immersive, rich touch interactions for their apps.\nNotes\nKyle Poole and Thomas Bruketta will co-present this talk. This dynamic duo has been crafting React Native applications at Instrument (here in Portland) over the last year for global clients. Both developers are contributors to the React Native open source community and Kyle Poole has created a collection of React Native primitives called Constelation that are a part of our team’s daily workflow .",

Our product is nearly as complex as other p2p marketplaces such as Airbnb in terms of features and numbers of screens.\nOur first mobile app was built in 2015 with Ionic (Angular.js based framework for building hybrid Cordova / Phonegap apps). This year we decided to rewrite it from scratch using React Native. We’ll share the reasons why we made some decisions regarding our new app and how we have layout our new architecture.\nAs newcomers to RN as we were, one of the problems we face was the lack of RN / Redux examples for complex apps, i.e. more than 5 or 10 screens. We hope that by sharing our experience we can help others overcome this.\nNotes\nI still have to detail a little bit more the outline of the talk.

    "description": "Breaking Down Bridging in React Native by Peggy Rayzis of Major League Soccer\n\nTalk Abstract\nCrossing the bridge between native and JavaScript code can seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to be! This talk will simplify the process of bridging native modules & components by breaking down common patterns found in bridging implementations for iOS & Android.\nTalk Description\nWhether you’re integrating a brownfield native application, an existing native component, or a third-party SDK into your React Native project, you will eventually have to cross the bridge between native code and JavaScript. This process can definitely be intimidating, especially if you’re coming from a JavaScript background. In my talk, I will demystify the bridging process by exposing common patterns and best practices for bridging native components and modules. To simplify bridging concepts, I will show you how to use react-native-create-bridge, a CLI that auto-generates native module & component templates in Obj-C, Swift, and Java. You’ll also learn how to communicate between native modules and JS code by properly utilizing eventDispatcher (iOS) and DeviceEventEmitter (Android). By the end of this talk, you’ll leave feeling confident enough in the fundamental concepts of bridging to build a native component or module and use it in your React Native app.",

The problem is that `div` and `span` are a hidden dependency on `react-dom`, and similarly, React Native's `View` is an explicit dependency on Native, making both not quite as \"cross-platform\" as we want them to be. Learn how we as a community can get around these issues, and what we can unlock by doing so.",

Our provider of choice will be Amazon’s AWS ecosystem and AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito and API Gateway will be among the resources covered.\nTalk Description\nThis talk will explore using the Amazon AWS ecosystem of technologies from React Native Apps.\nWe’ll explore the characteristics of a Serverless Architecture and how it can can aid any React Native developer in building scalable backends for their applications.\nOur focus will shift to building a Lambda to provide the responses to data needed from an example React Native application.\nThe orchestration of this will be done via the Serverless Framework written to ease the burdens of managing the lifecycle of a serverless architecture.\nThe example we will talk through will focus on delivering a AWS Lambda, but we will discuss how using a framework such as this for abstraction and orchestration can allow for deploying Alexa Skills, mobile and IoT services serverless architectures.\nFinally we’ll have a look at interacting with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3 and SNS using Amazon’s AWS SDK for React Native (currently in Developer Preview) https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-react-native\nAttendees will walk away from the talk with knowledge of how a React Native application can interact with a few basic services written and deployed on AWS Lambda via the Serverless Framework. The data for the services will be retrieving from DynamoDB tables which will be also be orchestrated via the framework. We will also talk briefly about authentication in React Native with AWS Cognito and how it can be setup as an auth solution for storing and accessing user data in Cognito attributes as well as data stored in DynamoDB and S3.\nNotes\nThe focus will be on delivering the data via an AWS Lambda written in Node.js using the Serverless framework for automation and accessing from React Native. Additional service interaction as mentioned above will be added for demo purposes.\nAWS Lambda’s are containerized functions run to perform compute and then destroyed. They are used to deliver the data for a users’ request directly from the AWS Lambda or via AWS API Gateway.",

Together we will look at how to evaluate when native code is the better choice. I’ll cover strategies for dealing with performance issues and how to handle background tasks like geolocation.\nTalk Description\nThe promise of writing an app in Javascript for iOS and having it “just work” out of the box on Android is a tempting one. That along with hot reloading and the ability to push over the air updates to published apps make React Native a tempting proposition, especially for web developers who are unfamiliar with native development and want to leverage their knowledge of React.\nHowever certain use-cases still require native code. Together we will take a look at some of these exceptions and how to evaluate when native code is the better choice out of necessity or performance concerns.\nThis talk will be from the perspective of an experienced iOS developer who has been working with React Native and has shipped several cross platform apps with native components.\nThings I will talk about:\nOverview of how React Native works\nOverview of iOS/Android application states and how that effects your apps design\nApp use-cases that require native code\nExample app with native code that uses geolocation in the background (code available on github)\nHow to use native tools to profile your app (with example app, available on github)\nStrategies for dealing with performance issues\nCooking demo where I port a Javascript component to Native and show differences in performance (code available on github)",

This talk will focus on distilling all of those requirements into actionable, easy to follow steps that you can use to deliver your next app.\nWe’ll do this by examining an app crafted specifically for this talk, which you can use throughout the conference!\nNotes\nFirst and foremost, here’s what will make this talk great: I want to create an app specifically for Chain React Conf that allows users to take photos of anything and everything going on. To make this even better, I would like to partner with a designer at Infinite Red to provide 1-3 photo frames to choose when taking a photo that has the conference branding.\nThe current plan is to have the app leverage Firebase via Firestack to allow for real-time updates. Due to how the app would be used, this talk is best suited for early in the conference lineup to get people using it. If we really want to take things up a notch, we can create a page for the conference web site that shows all of the photos in real time without much additional effort.",

    "description": "Building websites is a very visual process. The goal often is to make a website that is visually appealing and easy to use. However, we're always building websites with code. Changing margins is done by typing, changing font styles is done by typing, and every change often requires you to wait a while before you can see the result.During this talk I want to explore how we can make our development tooling more visually oriented. What can we do to lower the feedback loop and make it easier to create beautiful websites and apps?",

    "description": "What if it was possible to build backend features for our react apps in the same way that we use redux in our react apps? In this live-coding demo, I will show you how we’ll add backend business logic using the redux abstractions of dispatching actions, writing reducers as pure functions and subscribing to updated state. Our backend will be completely serverless and using open-source and managed services so that we’re not actually deploying and maintaining any servers. We will use GraphQL mutations from our React app to dispatch actions. These will trigger serverless functions which are pure and return the modified state, which will be persisted safely on a cloud managed database. Portions of your app that are subscribed to the state using GraphQL subscriptions (live-queries) will automatically update! You will witness the raw awesomeness of being able to use JavaScript and GraphQL in a pattern that you are comfortable with to build backend features from scratch",

Companies like Facebook and Airbnb leverage OSS as a source of brand equity and recruiting, among other advantages. However, OSS is still uncomfortable for many companies — and even if they do open source their tools, these projects often fail to launch — because they’re missing the most important (and best) part of OSS: the community.Projects that survive in today’s landscape have thriving communities that care deeply about the quality and advancement of open source and the people using it. But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including: 1. Offering open pair programming hours 2. Trusting all contributors with merge access 3. Sending free swag to contributors... And much more!

    "description": "High velocity native mobile development requires us to adopt continuous integration workflows, which means our reliance on manual QA has to drop significantly. The most difficult part of automated testing on mobile is the tip of the testing pyramid – E2E. The core problem with E2E tests is flakiness – tests are usually not deterministic. React Native makes flakiness worse due to the async nature of the bridge. We believe the only way to tackle flakiness head on is by moving from blackbox testing to graybox testing and that’s where detox comes into play. The library synchronizes with the lifecycle of the app, including React Native core, making tests finally deterministic.\n\nReactNext 2017\nTel Aviv, Israel",

Yet, there’s a limit to the magic that even React can pull off. There are times we need to help it, and often we might actually hurt the performance of our applications.\n\nIn this talk I will do a live demo of investigating and resolving performance issues such as how immutable state' can actually adversely affect performance or how inefficient selectors can lead to components unnecessarily re-rendering. Using the Chrome Dev Tools and other profiling tools provided by React itself, we will discover how to find what's causing slowdowns.

    "description": "ReactNext 2018\nwww.react-next.com\n@reactnext\n\nImmer is a tiny package that allows you to work with immutable data structures with unprecedented ease. It doesn't require learning new data structures or update APIs, but instead creates a temporarily shadow tree which can be modified using the standard JavaScript APIs. The shadow tree will be used to generate your next immutable state tree. This shadow tree is maintained using Proxies.\n\nProxies are an exotic javascript feature that is nowadays available in all modern browsers. What are they, how do they work and why should you (not) use them?\n\nJoin this talk to learn more about Proxies, or about how to deal with immutability data structures with a better DX as was ever possible so far. Brace yourself; your reducers will become twice as short without giving up on any of the semantic constraints.\n\nSlides for the talk: (including source code of the demos): http://immer-react-next-2018.surge.sh\n\n\nMichel Weststrate - Mendix, Tech Lead & OSS Evangelist\nTech Lead and Open Source evangelist at Mendix. Speaker, blogger and author of MobX, MobX-state-tree, immer and several other libraries.",

But it turns out there are a couple of other patterns that are useful when building larger react applications. \n\nThis talk covers topics like how to inject services into your component tree, how to deal with different designs for different screen sizes when media queries just don't cut it, how to really keep presentation components clean and simple and where to put the complicated bits. It also touches on some of the dark arts of what's really possible with JSX.\n\nRobert Herbst - GoDaddy, SDE IV\nRobert is a lover of all things code related and passionate about sharing \"Aha!\" moments he experiences.

It starts with the flow from the product moving to design and then to the RND. However, it does not stop there, there is a need to go back and forth with the process as specs and design might change. Using DDD, we can leverage the ability to describe the spec visually, for the product and other stakeholders.\n\nUsing atomic design, we can create our MVP fast and ready for scale. Oppose to design systems, Atomic design gives us the granularity we need, and a way to compose our app parts very fast and stable.\n\nAlon is a Senior Tech Lead @TWiK\nA JavaScript enthusiast with a mentorship core and a 100% hands-on approach.",

    "description": "ReactNext 2019\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n@reactnext\n\nRedux-sagas became a pretty common tool to handle asynchronous actions in the react-redux ecosystem. However, often I saw that not all asynchronous events are handled with it although redux-sagas have event channels which allow you to listen and react to any asynchronous routine (e.g. socket connections or external signals) and not just redux actions. \n\nExpect some live coding in this talk: We will implement a redux-saga event channel to catch signals of bluetooth beacons (why on earth do I try a hardware live demo!). Besides, this talk want to strengthen your understanding of generator functions (the backbone of redux-sagas). To this end, we will dive into a naive implementation of async-await to understand generator functions, and as a result, redux-sagas better.\n\nAs a freelancer software engineer, André builds and improves React and React Native apps. In his projects he often introduces new tools and puts an emphasis on clean code. He worked a lot with bluetooth beacon technology and created a popular open-source library in this field. As data scientist he digs through data and tries to discover interesting relations. You can often find André at hackathons, which he already successfully participated in 19 times. If he doesn’t code, André teaches kids how to program at science festivals all around the world or explains scientific topics to general audiences at science slams throughout Germany.",

    "description": "ReactNext 2019\n@reactnext\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n\nFor most of us, “static sites” only work for simple sites, like personal blogs. But static sites can do so much more! In this talk, learn how Gatsby uses React and GraphQL to help you build apps that combine the performance and workflow benefits of static sites with the flexibility and power of server-driven sites, all in a modern dev stack!\n\nDustin is from the middle of America: Omaha, Nebraska. He’s happy to report that it’s not _only_ cows and cornfields. He works for an awesome startup GatsbyJS: an excellent, blazing-fast app generator for React. You can find him regularly working on all things open source and all things JavaScript.",

Aspects like structuring and organizing your codebase, code sharing across teams, speeding up build and test runs can play a huge role in terms of productivity for a developer team. Those aspects impact small teams but get even more evident as your team grows and especially for large enterprises. \nIn this talk, I will show you how to avoid a monolithic codebase, how to modularize your React app and how that might even help you speed up your CI builds: thus help you scale development as your team grows. We'll be doing this in a very concrete and practical way, using Nx as our toolkit.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

Survey Monkey’s best-in-class digital products were being held back by fragmentation and complexity, which created a lot of rework and wasted effort for their engineering teams. Working together, we implemented a number of process and architecture changes that cut the complexity and improved workflows, letting our blended team deliver results with speed and consistently, even early in the engagement. These were not one-size-fits-all solutions, but solves that were unique and fitted to the needs of the engineering and product teams. The success of the project was due to Survey Monkey’s motivated teams that were: 1) Ready to embrace change; 2) Able to keep a firm focus on the outcomes; and 3) Readily understood the complexity of the project.\nThis allowed us to co-create some non-intuitive solutions that engineers at similar enterprise-level companies should know about.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

If you ask me, the answer is feature flags! Feature flags are beneficial because they allow you to test your code in production, perform canary releases, and even conduct A/B testing. The power of React makes it easy to implement these flags.

As teams and projects scale, and technologies change over time, being able to provide a universal component library as a design system for an entire organization proves to be difficult.\n\nStencil was created to help address this issue, most notably for Ionic, which is a UI library for mobile app development using web-technologies. In this talk we’ll walk through how Ionic is able to create an Ionic React library, using custom elements (web components) as the lowest level. Using the Stencil compiler, the Ionic team is able to generate various bindings for each of the frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.\n\n\nThe benefit of this allows the design team to focus on maintaining one codebase, while the Stencil compiler does the heavy lifting to generate the various output targets. Additionally, end-users of each framework binding get to interact with their traditional component model they’re familiar with. React developers use @ionic/react no differently than any other React component, and the same goes for Angular and Vue.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

As new engineering teams continued to spin up new frontend microservices, our custom-built platform grew increasingly fragmented. This led to more headaches for our teams, who were struggling to keep up with maintenance patches and security updates. What could we do to get ourselves out of this mess?\n\nCome join us as we discuss how we built a new platform with Next.js at its core to solve the challenges we faced. With the momentum of the Next.js community, we were able to extend this framework with a unique plugin architecture that allowed our engineers to hot-swap new packages and tools while allowing us to upgrade entire swaths of the stack at once. At the same time, we've multiplied the productivity (and happiness) of every frontend engineer at Lyft. We'll end with some great things to share that can be taken with you to address the challenges you face scaling your own frontend platforms!\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

In an age of ever-increasing cybersecurity threats, more and more software companies are shying away from undertaking these high levels of responsibility and liability.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll see how to build a user authentication system in react using magic, where magic provides a key-based identity solution built on top of the Decentralized Identity (DID) standard, where users’ identities are self-sovereign by leveraging blockchain public-private key pairs. These key pairs are used to generate zero-knowledge proofs to authenticate users instead of having to rely on users providing passwords to Magic or any identity provider.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

Being able to learn and predict the behavior of users has many powerful applications, one of them is the chance to boost the UI performance by prefetching code & resources before the user reaches them. In this talk, we describe a high-level implementation of an intelligent prefetcher, using ReactJS and TensorFlow.js. We use neural networks to learn the user's behaviour, and leverages React's lazy-loading API to prefetch components according to predictions. There is a chance for Frontend developers to explore the powerful combination of UI and AI.\n\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

Flux or MVC or MVVM? Redux, MobX or Apollo? Instead of answering the question, in this talk we will look at JavaScript code on a more fundamental level: How do data structures work in JavaScript. What assumptions can be we make if we treat them to be immutable? Or mutable? How can we express concepts like identities, references, collections, mutations, derivations in either case? And can we bent the rules between the two? This talk will provide you a deeper understanding of the difference between state and data. A deeper understanding of JavaScript itself. Which will help you to improve the state you manage, regardless of the library you use to implement that.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

The complicated data manipulation, the validation, the process flow of our apps. In other words, the business logic. If React is designed for the view layer, and we’re using Redux or something similar for the state, then where does the business logic go?

Styling? Got it. Animations? A little different, but sure. Now let's add a navigation bar and another screen that we transition to...\nThis is where you hit a fork in the road. You can either use a library that wraps the native navigation APIs for the platform or a re-implementation of those APIs using the same React Native primitives (View, Text, Animated, etc) that you use throughout your app. The former is commonly called “native navigation\" because most of the implementation is in \"native\" and the latter is called \"JavaScript-based navigation\" because most of the implementation is in JavaScript. React Navigation is a \"JavaScript-based\" navigation solution and React Native Navigation is a \"native\" navigation library. The choice you make has a significant impact on your app, and it's something you will live with every day while you continue to work on the project.\nI lead the React Navigation along with the creator of the project, Eric Vicenti. I'll explain why we think that building a JavaScript-based navigation library is important, what the limitations are (why there is room for both categories of solutions), and I'll show you how to take full advantage of it.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

After all, React’s whole purpose is managing updates to the DOM so we don’t have to. D3, on the other hand, is a library for building data visualizations, and it too needs access to the DOM. And stepping back, when should we even use D3 and React together? In this talk, I will give guidelines on when React should have ownership of the DOM, and when D3 should instead. More importantly, I will cover the interactions and applications that will benefit the most from using D3 and React, together.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Over the years companies and developers have invested a lot of time and money in development of UI components based on VanillaJS or various frameworks. Building components is time consuming, has integration and maintenance risks, and worst of all, distracts developers from the task at hand - actually building the application. In this presentation, you will learn how to quickly and easily “Reactify” your existing JavaScript components to use them in React applications.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

What databases or search engines can I use it with? How do you aggregate data from multiple sources globally? Can GraphQL fetched data be available offline, and if clients mutate it how are conflicts resolved? Is there a secure way to control data access based on user authentication? Do subscriptions scale to thousands or millions of users? How do I use it with content like images or video? We’ll learn about AWS AppSync, a managed GraphQL service with offline and realtime features, and see the latest features and functionality that have just been released to market.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

A few of these can be aggregated into a \"networking\" layer that manages the transfer of data. This layer was designed to mimic an API we have in the Web, but despite all the similarities, it has its own *qualities* and caveats every good React Native developer should know about. In this talk I'll try to guide you through the networking layer in React Native and share some tips and tricks I've learned along the way.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

That is, completely different from what we have used to be doing - when writing imperative code. In fact, imperative itself is often blamed on Twitter for being highly dangerous and an anti-pattern. In this talk, we will explore different ways of building reusable libraries with React Native (like APIs and higher order components). We will see that imperative code is actually there at low-level and is what makes communication with native world possible.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

It’s a lean wrapper around OpenGL and WebGL and allows truly cross-platform games to be written rather easily.\nReason is great for a whole lot of things, but let me take you through a story of trying to write a 2D physics engine in just under 8 hours (Mistakes were made), what strongly typed languages don’t protect you off, and a vision of what you could build with Reason or Reprocessing. The universal future is coming, and Reason is orienting itself just right with projects like bsb-native.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalised, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like prototypes.\n\nAt Mendix these restrictions where unacceptable and so MobX was born. MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. This makes state management simple and scalable again.\n\nSlides are https://speakerdeck.com/reactamsterdam/michel-weststrate-mendix-rotterdam-state-management-is-easy\n\nIf you tweet, don't forget to #reactamsterdam tag it!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

What is our UX today on web and mobile and how it will change when the digital world will bridge into new dimensions. Would we still use keyboard and mouse or gestures or will we use something else? In this talk we will get a glimpse into the future where we will control apps with our thoughts. Literally. It’s not a thought experiment, but a journey into our brainwaves with consumer EEG headset. We will explore how we can use them and AI to create futuristic experiences, which will lay a foundation stone to our future interactions with the digital world.\n\nVladimir Novick\nIndependent Consultant, engineer and trainer, Google Developer Expert, worldwide speaker and published author.

Many developers swear by the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) philosophy while others prefer to Write Everything Twice (WET). But which of these produces more maintainable codebases? I've seen both of these approaches lay waste to codebases and I have a new ideology I would like to propose to you: Avoid Hasty Abstractions (AHA). In this keynote, we'll talk about abstraction and how you can improve a codebase by applying and creating abstractions more thoughtfully as well as how to get yourself out of a mess of over or under-abstraction.\n\nKent C.

Teams need to share core functionality while staying autonomous. Changes need to propagate through many projects while being tested. [Nx](https://nx.dev/) is an open-source toolkit that allows organizations to scale development more easily than before! Nx makes setting up Cypress, Prettier, Storybook, Next.js, and Gatsby faster than ever. You can also develop full-stack by using Node frameworks like Apollo and Nest.js and share code between frontend and backend. In this talk you’ll learn how large organizations like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google are able to successfully scale across multiple teams, business units, and products.\n\nJason Jean\nJason is an Architect at Nrwl on the Nx Core Team. He works with Fortune 500 companies across different industries to enable them to develop like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. Along with development, Jason is also an enthusiast of board games and mechanical keyboards.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

New features need to be built that are sort of similar to features that already existed, but what bits they can reuse is not clear (eg: pagination). New members join the team and we’d like them to work on their UI components without worrying about the data fetching logic of the rest of the component tree. Relay takes an opinionated stance to solve some of these problems that are worth understanding and learning from.\nIn this talk, I'm going to motivate the core features in Relay from the ground-up. I'll do hands-on demos to explain the common challenges GraphQL clients run into, how one would fix them without Relay and then fix them with Relay. I'll also touch upon how Relay works and its design briefly and how Relay’s design goal is not just being a high-performance GraphQL client, but also increasing developer productivity and happiness.\n\nTanmai Gopal\nTanmai Gopal is the CEO, co-founder of Hasura.

Since then we have discovered patterns on how to best structure and implement a GraphQL API. In this talk we will share some of these patterns and provide examples on how to implement them.\n\nLink to event page https://www.meetup.com/React-Amsterdam/events/237423993/\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

At first sight everything is great - clear project structure, efficient reuse of codebase, less bugs and less response time which give us amazing UX. But what is actually happening when we deploy our application on the server? Why our application is running slower on high load? How to scale and how to get high availability? Just to order more servers? There is few betters solutions.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

My team learned several lessons when a seemingly tiny user story sent us right back to the drawing board, because our router couldn’t handle the scenario. Based on this experience, I will address several patterns that are available in modern routing frameworks. How to creatively leverage the router to solve problems? How to keep things simple? And seeing the router as the main player in wiring all components together: what can we do to make it a truly strong foundation?\n\nReact Amsterdam May Meetup http://www.meetup.com/React-Amsterdam/events/230900476.\n\nIf you tweet, don't forget to #reactamsterdam tag it!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Maybe. Or perhaps I’ll draw on my experience working both on free and open source tools (jQuery, jQuery UI, NativeScript), as well as paid tools (Kendo UI, KendoReact), and discuss which type of tool makes sense depending on your team and needs.

This was a pain point for our team while rebooting our design system. We discovered that although our system was built with inclusivity in mind, our documentation setup was equal parts brittle and complex —  especially when working with our React-based component library. Multiple repos, rigid layout restrictions, and an impressive amount of gymnastics were needed to render React component examples. \n\nDocumentation became a maintenance nightmare for the core team — and a barrier to entry for external contributors. Our team was in danger of having stale documentation while our system’s features were still being built. In this talk, you’ll learn how we streamlined our component library documentation tooling with Gatsby and MDX. Pair this with inclusive best practices, and your component library documentation will be silky smooth.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with a documentation system that’s tough to maintain, this session is for you.\n\nSlides - https://noti.st/resource11/2uy6Ol/smoothly-inclusive-component-library-documentation",

CDK is a next-level abstraction in infrastructure as code, allowing developers who were traditionally unfamiliar with cloud computing to build scalable APIs and web services using their existing skillset, and do so in only a few lines of code. In this talk, you’ll learn how to use the TypeScript flavor of CDK to build a hyper-scalable real-time API with GraphQL, Lambda, DynamoDB, and AWS AppSync . At the end of the talk, I’ll live code an API from scratch in just a couple of minutes and then test out queries, mutations, and subscriptions. By the end of the talk, you should have a good understanding of GraphQL, AppSync, and CDK and be ready to build an API in your next project using TypeScript and CDK.",

Some are introduced by us, others by other teams or systems. Some are painfully obvious and affect all users, others only occur in edge (cases). And the ways of finding, and eventually, preventing them, are just as diverse: be it snapshot, unit, integration, end to end tests or automated visual tests, every kind comes with its challenges and opportunities. Testing UIs is hard, but in the end, only test automation can give us the confidence we need to move fast and refactor our code relentlessly. In this talk we are going to look at what kinds of bugs there are, which tests are most effective for catching which, and how we can implement them using modern front end technologies.\n\nSlides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HIdY3-DfRNB4Mjp6sEvlp7Pt_nKFvx5F5Qlgnf6mq4I/edit?usp=sharing",

Congrats! I am sure it is awesome but did you put the same effort into its documentation? Component libraries tend to have giant APIs, dozens of components, hundreds of props and thousands of permutations. That is a lot of information to unpack.\n\nWe could make the documentation very long or... super interactive. We combined component previews, API documentation, props editing and code editing into a single seamless experience. You can quickly explore various settings of each component while watching the code write itself.\n\nThis talk will show you how to leverage common tools and concepts such as Prettier, babel and AST transformations to build the documentation that can literally work for you.\n\nSlides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eniROQoSzMWax1sliB9s_TMgKwn84xXfSXow1sJXesM/edit?usp=sharing",

Its author is the Japan noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu. Till then countless of writers put their thoughts on paper and countless of readers experience their stories. People write for decades and we, as software developers, kind of ignore their craft. We write too. Not novels but software. Isn't it this still writing? Believe it or not there is a lot in common between creating fiction and writing code. In this presentation we will see how close we are to giants like Hemingway and Stephen King. Can we get some of their wisdom and apply it to our daily job as engineers. Come to this talk and will get a few practical advices. I hope my presentation will make you a slightly better React developer.\n\nSlides - https://we-are-all-hemingway.vercel.app/#/",

Which ones are particular to building React components and applications? Is TypeScript worth the learning curve?\n\nIn this session geared towards devs with prior experience building React applications, let’s answer those questions. We’ll walk through the common bugs that infect our apps and learn how the use of strong types with TypeScript can help prevent them.

In our eagerness to apply React to our most complex of problems and ship solutions today, we can get lost in the 🌲🌲🌲 forest of abstractions 🌲🌲🌲. When it comes to leveling up our skills in anything, Kent finds the most effective method is to take a step back and understand the foundational fundamentals. To strip away all abstraction until what we're left with is the bare bones. The better you understand an abstraction, the more effective you will be at using it. This talk will help you get more effective at using React Hooks, React Suspense, and JSX.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

When done successfully, it suddenly becomes trivial to translate standard designs into code. In fact, we may even find that this translation step starts to feel somewhat redundant. In a world of components, how should our design processes change? How should our tooling change? How should we, as React developers, better enable this change? In this talk, you'll see the current state of design and development, and where we could go—if we're willing to push for it.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

This is great because one tech team can build both your web app and native mobile experience. The problem is developers hate writing things twice. There have been a couple of efforts to build a unifying technology to write an application once and have it work on both web and native. Yet this is not always the best approach. There is value in only sharing your business and state logic; keeping your render code separate.\n\nIn this talk, Ben Elerby gives real examples from his work with MADE.COM, migrating their web and mobile application to React and React-Native with code sharing as a primary objective.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Then you started getting some users and suddenly you needed multiple instances of your Monolith Backend and more replicas of your Database. Your user base kept growing and also your development team was growing, so you split your Monolith backend into Microservices with their own Databases.\n\nYou’re very happy about the situation until you realize that the same problem you had on the backend it’s now on the frontend. Multiple teams are working on the same codebase, it’s hard to do frequent releases and there’re a lot of cross-team communications that slow things down.\n\nDAZN battle-tested the Microfrontends architecture leveraging feature like blue-green deployments in the frontend, framework agnostic teams and drastically reduced cross-team dependencies.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Florian shows how to leverage the React ecosystem to create performant applications: architecture, patterns, typing, useful open-source modules and tooling... and how to go one step further and provide a better user experience as well as a better developer experience.\n\nThese apps are not web apps, they are not native apps, they are hybrid 'Native Web Apps' and can provide the best of both worlds.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

React is built primarily for the browser, while Node has fundamentally different operational constraints to the browser. While working as a Principal Architect and Consultant, it has become painfully clear to David that React’s Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a performance bottleneck for web backends around the world. This talk demonstrates a very simple solution that can be dropped into pre-existing React applications to vastly improve the throughput of an SSR Node server (around 20-40x+).\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In principle, you can paint almost anything you can dream of. In practice, WebGL is hard, and though projects like three.js make it easier, there are still a lot of hurdles to integrating it into your site in a practical way.\n\nLet's explore how Hooks can make it easier to integrate powerful GPU-driven visuals into our React apps, giving us the best of both worlds: the power of WebGL with the ease and expressiveness of a React component tree.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Adam's team could have pursued a typical release strategy—instead, they got creative with React Native.\n\nThey built a strangler-style architecture, a technique commonly reserved for web services, to release our greenfield React Native product user-by-user. The effect was some pretty unique and awesome advantages to how we built and tested our new app—but software is never perfect.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

By splitting our app into small, digestible parts the system as a whole becomes a lot easier to understand.\nCSS was made in an era where documents were the height of the web. It doesn't fit easily into component-based systems, making styling one of the pain points of building React applications.\nWhat if we took the best of JavaScript and the best of CSS, and combined them together to create the ultimate solution? Glen Maddern (CSS Modules co-creator) and I sat down and starting thinking about styling in this new paradigm. Let's talk about what we thought about and why we arrived where we did – 💅 styled-components.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

As if it is an elevated way of thinking, only accessible to the chosen few. Nothing is less true! It is the most natural way to look at programming problems. You just might not realize it yet! In this talk, Michel will demonstrate that many complex UI problems, such as form validation and routing, can all be seen as '*actions* that change *facts* which leads to *reactions*'. And as soon as we start distinguishing those concepts in our applications; our code will become more declarative, more concise and less imperative.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In this talk, Forbes will help you through that initial stage by identifying some of the problems you're likely to experience and giving you the tools to work through them. We'll cover adding types to code that initially looks too dynamic to type, adding runtime type checking (and whether that's a good idea) and finally, how you publish your type checked modules to npm.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Building 3D Worlds was an intimidating endeavour. Especially with ReactVR there is no reason for that anymore. The talk kicks off with the basics of WebVR, shows how to build and navigate rooms using panos in ReactVR. Next it shows how to create a couple 3D meshes and how put together a small world using them.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

With a wrong workflow linting can be really a pain and will slow you and your team down. With a proper setup though, it can save you hours of manual work reformatting the code and reducing the code-review overhead.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You quickly add some hello world text and maybe even a Pokemon image. Things are really starting to look up… \nAnd then you need to add another view and you realize that you need to navigate somewhere. So you check out the React Native Docs and are quickly greeted by IOSTabBar, Navigation, and NavigationExperimental modules. With so many different options in the core codebase you realize that it’s still a bit of an unsolved problem. Now you’re looking at 3rd party integrations… and you start to wonder, just how should you implement navigation? \nThis talk will outline the different approaches to navigation available in React Native and in the RN eco-system, and the pro’s and con’s of each solution.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

They thought the real engineers programmed the server in Java, while the script kiddies played around with it's wannabe little brother, JavaScript. But, in the last several years, React and its ilk have proven that sophisticated approaches to immutability and asynchrony allow for unprecedented scale and complexity in the front-end. Now, the tables have turned, and back-end frameworks are starting to wake up to the benefits of asynchronous processes and event sourcing patterns, following the trail that React has blazed.",

I came to engineering from the world of creative writing and what surprised me the most is how similar code is to fiction. React itself follows tenants of creative writing and when you lean into those rules, you create solid component architecture. Inn this talk you’ll learn how to write React like its fiction and what you can gain by doing so.",

However, one barrier to feature parity is the difficulty of creating a native-like UI transition and interaction experience on the mobile web, especially on lower-end devices. I’ll be discussing various considerations, tips and techniques to create a web app in React that looks, moves, and feels as close to a native mobile app as possible.",

    "description": "At Docker, we are using GraphQL alongside our existing REST APIs and making it work without a GraphQL server. Instead, we use GraphQL client side, where it serves as the interface to our network layer and the glue that binds our components together. We have taken this approach as a progressive solution to the difficult problem of introducing GraphQL to an existing application stack. By breaking the rules a bit we gain many of the benefits that GraphQL provides immediately while spreading out the implementation over many releases. While a novel approach I also envision a future where running GraphQL on the client is not uncommon. With the advent of blockchain technology and the concept of “dapps” we must reconsider the role of the application that runs on the end user’s device. By running GraphQL on the client we can consume remote GraphQL services, interact directly with the blockchain, browser / native APIs, and more through GraphQL.\n\nTyler is an engineer at Docker working on UI applications.

When we see people modernize their app architecture and move to React, they often want to migrate their API to GraphQL as part of the same effort. But while React is super easy to adopt in a small part of your app at a time, GraphQL can seem like a much larger investment. In this talk, we’ll go over the fastest and most effective ways for React developers to incrementally migrate their existing APIs and backends to GraphQL, then talk about opportunities for improvement in the space. If you’re using React and are interested in GraphQL, but are looking for an extra push to get it up and running at your company, this is the talk for you!\n\nSashko has been working on open source developer tools for the last 5 years. Most recently he has been leading open source GraphQL tool development at Apollo, after writing the very first versions of Apollo Client.

    "description": "Accessibility in React has been a hot topic in the last few years, but in this talk, we'll be going beyond the basics. We'll explore a data-driven perspective to convince the business to invest in accessibility, then dive into the details of accessibility testing. We'll use lighthouse to audit applications, educate ourselves with the axe browser extensions, incorporate eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y into our lint process, and add axe-core to our automated testing suite. You'll leave prepared to add accessibility features to your application.\n\nJen Luker is a Lead software engineer at Formidable, a BookBytes podcast co-host, and a member of the RxJS learning team. She has spent a majority of her decade-long career as a full-stack developer using PHP, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular fondness for front end technologies. Jen trains others in ReactJS and accessibility, loves optimizing webpack builds, and codes apps in React Native. When she's not finding solutions, learning new technologies, or reading, her spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting; she's even been known to 3D print her own tools for the job. Jen is also fascinated by all things space, enjoys vintage cars, and is always looking for good conversation.\n\nFilmed at Reactathon September 2018 at GitHub in San Francisco, CA. \n\nOrganized by Real World React.

But, with so many CSS in JS solutions, how do you know which one to choose? In this talk, I will cover five different ways to style your React projects, and the pros and cons of each approach. From CSS Modules with SASS to Styled Components, you’ll learn how each library works so that you know which one(s) best fits your needs.\n\nJoe Seifi is a senior software engineer at Eventbrite in San Francisco.

    "description": "The promise of writing code for iOS and having it “just work” out of the box on Android is a tempting one. That along with hot reloading code and the ability to push over the air updates to published apps make React Native a tempting proposition. This sounds too good to be true so what’s the catch? React Native is a framework for building native apps using Javascript. Many native developers rightly associate hybrid Javascript apps with disappointing consumer experiences and frustrating development environments. Over the years the same promises have been made by many other Javascript based frameworks, so why is React Native any different? This talk will be from the perspective of an experienced iOS developer who has been working with React Native for the last 2 years and has shipped several cross platform apps with it.\n\nHarry is an iOS developer who is very enthusiastic about React Native. Currently he works as a mobile contractor with various companies. In the past he’s worked as a Software Engineer at Facebook, Apple and a number of startups you've probably never heard of.",

There were some other platforms maintained by third-party developers, but these forks sometimes run with older React Native versions. The main reason is the difficulty to follow rapidly changed upstream code. From the upcoming React Native new architecture, there will be more platform-independent shared implementations and more abstraction layers. Let's see if we could extend React Native to some new platforms benefiting from the new architecture.",

Previously, Ram had written and spoken about adding instrumentation to understand the performance characteristics of the app.\nAs the next step, he will explore the various optimizations that can be done in this talk. He will focus on the Javascript section, something where there are many more low hanging fruits to optimizie.\nStarting from React Dev Tools, he will look at how developers can leverage their existing knowledge of web performance to attack mobile perf. He will talk about understanding SysTrace and Sampling Profilers. He will also debunk common myths like the problems with measuring app performance using Chrome JS profiler, debug versions of the app, etc. \nIn this talk, he will plan to outline a holistic approach that can be used to dive deeper into React Native performance.",

    "description": "Abstract:\nIn the past 5 years, the Wix mobile app has gone through quite a bit - a brand new look was launched, a large number of features were added in a short period of time, and the number of our users tripled. Unfortunately, one implication of product growth, is a slower performance, especially when it came to things like seamless transition, fluent animations and general slickness of the app. \n\nOver the past year, we made a tremendous effort to improve these regressions. Our ongoing efforts have so far resulted in almost 60% cumulative improvement in all performance metrics.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll deep into all of our secret ingredients for better performance in React Native applications, together with practical examples of:\n-Improving startup time\n-Responsive gestures \n-Preload prioritization\nFurthermore, I’ll outline some general work we’ve done that led us to these improvements, like the right way to measure and analyse your app performance on production, and how you can implement these tips and tricks.",

I'll take you to quick introduction to Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Fundamentals of ARKit for iOS which is one of biggest AR platform and ARcore for Android. Will use Viro React to do live coding and build an experience like never before for audience. My target for this talk is to make React Native devs familiarised with this world of AR/VR so that they take advantage of this new skill by going through practical example and see for themselves how easy it is with React Native.",

    "description": "Abstract:\nReact empowered us to render user interfaces anywhere – in memory, browsers, mobile devices to name a few. Rendering in memory is cheap and fast compared to runtime environment, so in-memory UI testing libraries emerged. One of the most popular one now is React Testing Library. Soon after it went public, React Native Testing Library was created trying to implement their style of testing for React Native components. And a few months later another one came to light out of the blue, quickly becoming an official one. The community ended up with two almost identical libraries. Sounds confusing, huh? It was! This story is about all this drama, how it eventually turned out, how community and empathy wins, how businesses help sustain OSS, sprinkled with examples of how you can test your React Native components with just JavaScript.",

How do you propagate feature flagging configuration to mobile devices that don’t always have a strong network? As a mobile developer, you want to be able to use the latest flag configuration, but you also don’t want to stop someone using the app just because you can’t load the feature flag config. \n\nIn this talk, we'll start with why controlled rollout is important and how feature flags enable you to do it successfully, then we will talk about mobile specifics, and then a demo with React Native.",

    "description": "For the past 2.5 years I've been working on a bunch of projects, all aiming to expose some native capabilities to be controlled from JavaScript in React Native app. Most notable ones were: native driver support for Animated and two libraries: React Native Gesture Handler and Reanimated. All these projects were inspired by needs of navigation libraries and were meant to fill the gap between platform native navigation solutions and ones that are available in React Native.\nOur React Native projects often starts by deciding whether to go with native navigation (react-native-navigation) or JS navigation library (react-navigation). But given all these improvements can we still call react-navigation \"not native\"? In this talk we will learn how Gesture Handler and Reanimated libraries came to live with navigation being the driving force. In this context I will discuss how far is react-navigation from finally proclaiming the badge of really native navigation library.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/kmagiera/it-all-starts-with-navigation",

    "description": "How do you manage user data in your React Native app? A popular approach is to use Redux or MobX with a persistence adapter. This works great for small, simple apps, but it has a serious flaw: it doesn't scale very well. Introducing WatermelonDB — a next generation database for React and React Native. Here's why you should care: \n- Highly scalable. Works as well for 20,000 database records as it does for 100. Instant launch. No matter how much data you have, the app still launches with near-zero performance penalty \n- Lazy loaded everything. Don't load all data at launch, query only the exact records you need. That's why it's fast! \n- Fully reactive. All records and queries are observable using RxJS. A change in one place propagates to all other places automatically \n- Made for React. Comes with a HOC so you can declaratively tie together data and components \n- Relational. Document stores are simple, but relational databases are powerful. Want to find, say, all posts that have a comment by user X? Sure, that'll be about a millisecond. \n- Cross-platform. Works on iOS and Android (using SQLite), on the web (using LokiJS), and it's easy to add more \n- Performant. Uses asynchronous processing, multi-threading (also on the web), resource sharing, and caching to squeeze extra performance \n- Built for sync. Comes with syncing primitives so you can supply your own synchronization code",

We’ve decided it is time for Expo to be redesigned and split into multiple, separate native + JS (+ more 🤭) libraries which developers will be able to opt-out of using in Expo standalone apps and also to use in their plain RN projects. This talk will describe the process of making this transition, design of the solution we’ve settled on and difficulties we had to overcome along the way (and how we’ve done it).",

    "description": "Developers constantly strive to make stunning apps which not only solve day to day problems but augment life of their users in a way that the app becomes an important part of their lives. The examples of such disruptive apps is endless but at the same time it’s also important that an app for many does not leave few behind. In our quest for building next great app Apple and Android both provides apis to keep accessibility integral part of application design. In this talk I’ll be introducing this concept to every React Native developer and give handson how they can make use of voiceover, accessibility properties and other accessibility elements part of their RN app to make an application inclusive for all. I am equally excited to talk and give demo on this topic since such reminders have far reaching effect on developer community when they build their next app.",

    "description": "Asynchronous rendering is one of the core principles of React. On the web, the ability to batch updates and work on a virtual DOM proved to be key factors in improving rendering performance. The same architecture seems to do miracles in React Native and gives JavaScript the performance boost needed to render native views effectively. This benefit of React Native is also its greatest drawback. For certain types of problems in native mobile, asynchronous rendering introduces an overhead that is almost impossible to bridge. List views are a good example, as even the best implementation to date, FlatList, struggles to keep up with the fill rate of the most naive list implementation in pure native. Is it possible to introduce synchronous rendering to React Native and tackle this category of problems from a different direction?\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland.",

It was clear that better navigation instruments will come later but I didn't want to change my code again and again to switch for better API. Every new major version of RNRF is based on different navigation framework and mostly preserves own API. Another goal was to represent all navigation flow within one place in clear, human-readable way - similar to iOS Storyboards concept. This way other engineers could understand your app flow faster. I want to talk about latest version (v4) of RNRF based on ReactNavigation and MobX and provide best practices.

    "description": "Animations are one of the most important elements of modern, well-crafted mobile apps. Animation effects possible to achieve using native SDKs exceed by far the capabilities of mobile browsers, hence based on the quality of animations it is easy to tell the difference between truly native apps and ones that run in a webview. React Native provides several APIs for handling animations (layout animations, native navigator, Animated.js library). Some of them lets you directly leverage native SDK capabilities, others require round-trips over native-to-JS bridge. We will dive a little into implementation details of each of those methods to explain their limitations. I will also discuss native-animated-driver (the project I've been recently working on), and give some tips on how to make your React-Native app stay at 60FPS.",

Lean Analytics is a new approach which dives deeper into the measurement component of this process. With Lean Analytics we can measure the state of the application and make informed decisions about the product and its vision based on end user interactions. Redux allows us to maintain our application state in a single store, and provides a single location for state changes. By hooking analytics into this event loop we can infer a lot about end user behaviour. Our Redux Segment middleware allows you to draw deep and rich analytics from your Redux application with minimal configuration. In this talk, we will walk through the process of adding analytics to your existing Redux application and share our implementation which works with segment.io.",

Living on the edge with both React Native and Exponent, you'd be right to guess that we ran into our fair share of problems.

    "description": "Michael Chan at react-europe 2015.\n\nReact allows you to write styles inline and bypass a host of CSS shortcomings. Scope, dependency management, dead code elimination, these problems go away when adding your styles directly to components. But it's not all rainbows and unicorns. Things like theming and media queries become much more difficult when all your styles live directly on components. In this talk, we'll look at how to solve these problems with contexts and plain old JavaScript. We'll also look at the role of container-components and when it's better to \"just use CSS.\"",

    "description": "If you’ve browsed the internet on your phone recently, you’ve probably noticed a common phenomenon: mobile websites often try to get the user away from the site and onto an app as quickly as possible. How can front end developers advocate for the strengths of the mobile web, and build experiences so good that it’s not always necessary to point the user to a native app? This practical talk will review HTML & CSS best practices and then have a look at implementing some more advanced techniques in React.\n\nStorybook mobile https://storybook-mobile.netlify.app\n\nbundle-wizard, a powerful tool to analyze your bundles https://github.com/aholachek/bundle-wizard\n\nFollow Alex here https://twitter.com/alex_holachek\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/#tickets",

This means that monitoring network traffic and performance, using the React Devtools, inspecting device and application logs or even debugging JavaScript can now can now be conveniently done using one coherent tool.\n\nAnd best of all: Flipper is extensible, so let's build our own extension while at it!\n\nFollow Michel here https://twitter.com/mweststrate",

Yet, what if there was still a way?\n\nLet's investigate together what can be improved and added to our test strategies to make them even more reliable thanks to property based testing. But contrary to classical talk around property based testing, we are going to go further by extending it to user interfaces and race conditions detection.\n\nBy the end of this talk, our CI will have been turned into an automated QA identifying issues in our UI.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/#tickets",

It builds on Next.js and adds a new invisible data layer that removes the need to build your own API. It also brings conventions and development tooling like code scaffolding and an integrated code REPL.",

This is illustrated by introducing the notion of local state presented via a series of examples. State is changed by means of reducers, that can operate directly on the current component, or on distant components via remote actions. Further examples illustrate how certain animations can be considered instances of local state that can be easily composed.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

Then, we will dive into the API of React Navigation to see how easy it can be to implement an app with fully-featured navigation on iOS, Android, browser apps, and server-rendered React sites!\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

What if we could transpile these components into any language on any platform, such as a Swift components on iOS, or Kotlin components on Android?\n\nIn this talk, he demonstrates how React could fundamentally alter design and native development, just like it did for JavaScript.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

But React is so much more! Its architecture, designed to separate the DOM-specific fragments from the library core, makes it suitable for many other types of applications. In fact, React Native itself leverages these capabilities though its custom renderer that, instead of working with the DOM, manipulates native OS primitives.​ ​But how do those renderers work exactly? Can anyone write one? What makes them a better choice than, say, a regular template language? Are they limited to UI work? We'll discuss all that, and take a quick tour of the existing renderers made those past years.",

Blazing fast! But how much can you actually do with a static site. ANYTHING! In this talk we will look at how Gatsby can be used to build highly dynamic content - such as gated/authenticated content - without breaking the JAMstack workflow.\n\nThis talk will begin with a brief introduction to Gatsby and the JAMstack, detailing the performance benefits and unique problems that surface with static content. The main focus of the talk will be around dynamically building an authenticated API from markdown files at build time - keeping our workflow consistent for both public and protected content. This style of development would also allow all content to be tracked by git and easily rolled back.",

    "description": "Get next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html\n\nWriting UI that can be accurately translated often comes with tradeoffs. If the text is sufficiently complicated, engineers have to take great pains (write conditionals, which are often error-prone) to ensure it is accurately rendered in other languages. Additionally, engineers are often either required to (a) keep strings separate from UI, or (b) keep translatable text simple enough to be extracted from UI source.\n\nFbt is an explicit markup language that tackles complexity and keeps UI text bundled with the relevant source code. This has the added benefit of keeping UI source self-documenting. This markup is parsed at build-time with text collected and sent to translators. The framework enables engineers to write text that would normally be tedious and error-prone in a succinct and accurate way.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html",

In this talk, Sebastian will go over how this already existing infrastructure can be further utilised to perform even more significant code transformations such as transpilation, optimisation, profiling and more, reducing bugs, making your code faster and you as a developer more productive and happy.",

    "description": "At Twitter, teams have starting adopting React because it’s enabled UI engineers to forget about time when writing rendering code. And we've started exploring similar simplifications in the data layer, embracing the UI’s role as part of a distributed system. First, we'll share how user experience choices are a primary influence on how we design the data layer, especially for teams developing new products with full-stack capabilities. Working with data from multiple backend services has powerful benefits, and shapes the problem space for UI engineering. Next, we'll look at how React and Flux approaches can help in our problem scenarios. Yet even after the advances in React’s component model, the data layer is still an important source of complexity as an app grows and changes over time. Finally, we'll look at new approaches we’ve been exploring, and how designs like decoupling 'recording facts' from 'computing views of those facts' have influenced UI engineering. These designs nudge teams towards simplicity when creating impactful user-facing improvements like real-time updates, optimistic commits, and graceful handling of network outages.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/krob",

    "description": "React.js is changing the way developers think about mobile app development, especially with the recent announcement of React Native. However, in many ways hybrid (web + mobile) app development is here to stay for a large number of mobile apps. Everyone's heard \"you can't build a native experience in a web view\". We disagree. You just have to know the right tricks. And when you do, the web becomes an incredibly powerful platform for delivering amazing user experience using the technology you know. At Thinkmill in Sydney, over the course of developing several commercial apps, we've experienced the power of using ReactJS for mobile apps built on web technology, and developed a framework we call TouchstoneJS (which Tom Occhino called \"the best looking and feeling implementation of this that I've seen\" during the Q&A session at React Conf) to share this capability with developers around the world. In this talk I'll share what we've learned and how we've approached the unique challenges of mobile web apps - with tools that are useful to all developers building touch interfaces with React, as well as a walkthrough of our development process and framework. I'll also talk about what you can do with the web platform that you can't with native apps, and even React Native.",

Is it possible to create a transparent reactive, snapshotable state container. With support for JSON patches, replayable actions, serialization, complex object graphs. With Redux & MobX compatibility, strong typing and runtime type checks out of the box. Get a glimpse of what next-gen state management might look like with mobx-state-tree.

How can we combine the best of both functional and reactive paradigms to model and build predictable UIs that control themselves?\nIn this talk, Preethi will explain what “Functional Reactive Programming” is, how close React / Redux / Mobx / RxJs and others come in realizing Functional Reactive Programming, and what’s still fundamentally missing from these tools to achieve a true implementation of FRP. Lastly, she’ll describe when and why FRP is suitable (or not suitable) for building predictable and scalable UIs.",

Animated hooks can mend the gap between the declarative and the imperative and express intent more clearly, which has big implications on not only the moving thing itself but also with how we combine it with all the other things going on around it, from the data-model to user interaction.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html",

The cutting edge drum and bass sounds of drum and bass outfit Bad Company served as a backdrop to his early 2000’s tech startups, the award-winning forum Dogsonacid.com, and anti-piracy startup Darkstar LLC. But after 20 years of success in the music industry including signing acts like Pendulum and Chase and Status to his label Breakbeat Kaos and having the UK’s first ever Drum & Bass and Dubstep Number 1 records, Dan Stein contracted cancer, and after a narrow brush with death realised that he needed a change of pace. In 2017, he attended a Ruby boot-camp and two years later is a Machine Learning Developer at leading education research company HT2 Labs in Oxford, where his work has helped to win innovation awards. Stein believes that as our lives become more and more intertwined with technology that there are roles for everyone to be passionate about in the world of Tech. He’s here to tell us his story and explain why he thinks that developers are ‘Hot Right Now’.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://www.react-europe.org/next.html",

If your screens are built with sufficient isolation, they can be portable between apps, platforms, and navigation implementations. In this talk, we will discuss how this ultimate modularity can be achieved simply by utilizing reducers and single-directional data flow. Then we will use React Navigation to quickly build a new experience with these techniques, and see how portable it really is.",

We launched Croatian in May with little overhead beyond setting up the new domain and translating phrases. However, this was not true for all new languages; our next most requested language, Hebrew, posed a unique challenge. Because it reads right-to-left, the entire Hebrew UI must be flipped. Browsers only handle reversing the DOM structure, but styling and interactions must be coded manually.\n\nThis talk covers the journey of enabling right-to-left languages on airbnb.com. Recently, Airbnb has moved to a React frontend and away from Sass to a CSS-in-JS paradigm. We developed a performant and cross-browser solution for RTL that leveraged a CSS-in-JS abstraction layer to isolate the logic from our codebase. Our efforts led us most of the way to launching in Arabic and Hebrew while requiring little effort from our product engineers and with minimal disruption to their work.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

But runtime type systems can do many more things than just data validation. Because they are very flexible (as you can basically reuse the entire hosting language to express your types) it will be much less likely that you will run into structures that cannot be expressed in the type system. You can generate runtime types on the fly from other sources (json-schema, graphql etc) or compose them together.\n\nIn this talk I will walk you through some runtime type systems, like prop-types, tcomb and mobx-state-tree. But also show you how runtime- and compile-time type systems like TypeScript or Flow can co-exist and leverage each other.\n\nIf you thought so far Higher Order Components or render callbacks where cool, in this talk I will show you that these patterns can be applied in general to any data structure you have.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/yfHbBG",

What’s the biggest difference between type systems for JavaScript and an ML inspired language like OCaml or Haskell? Subtyping! Subtyping allows runtime values of some type to be used as a different type, and how a language designer chooses to address subtyping deeply affects every other design decision in the language. From the way values are represented in the runtime, to how effective type inference algorithms are, to the supported polymorphic code patterns. Implicit runtime subtyping is common in today’s most popular languages like JavaScript, Java, C#, and Ruby but the tradeoffs aren’t well understood. Subtyping is useful, but in today’s programming environment subtyping is overrated.\n\nGet next edition's tickets info here: https://goo.gl/zfEhBp",

    "description": "Abstract:\nOne of the things I love about React is how easy it is to encapsulate UI code into a component. I love this because it makes reuse of those components easy. But is it simple? I've made my fair share of components that had to accept a bunch of props to handle a growing list of different use cases resulting in a complex render function full of conditional statements and a confusing API for people using this \"reusable\" component. Eventually it becomes too much and I had to make a new version of the same component to handle slightly different use cases. Lots of code/bug duplication there because my reusable component wasn't reusable enough. It wasn't simple enough.\n\n\nThere are patterns that have emerged in React that allow you to promote code reuse without sacrificing the simplicity or flexibility of the component. In this talk we’ll cover some of these patterns that will make your React components more useful.",

It's handy, it's familiar, it kinda works, but maybe you've thought \"this could be better.\" And you're right: it can be. In this talk, you'll meet Reactotron, a free, open-source development tool for your React and React Native projects. You'll see how just a few lines of code will give you access to a world of useful information about what's going in your app. Get better stack traces on errors, peer into the gory details of your network requests, pry open your async storage, subscribe to Redux store changes, debug your sagas, and the list goes on. By the end, you'll be ready to start working with Reactotron in your own projects, and wonder how you ever worked without it.",

    "description": "Writing 3D applications for the browser is possible since some years due to the WebGL API. But since Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are getting more popular, web developers and designers now have a serious reason to get to know the 3D web, its APIs and design patterns.\nIn this talk you will learn how to create 3D applications in the browser, using ReactJS in combination with popular VR libraries, like A-Frame and ReactVR. You will also see what is necessary to create a Virtual Reality app that runs on common VR devices, and how to create Augmented Reality applications for Android and iOS phones.\nSince 3D user interfaces and interactions in the browser are relatively new for designers and users, there are no established UX design patterns yet, but you will get to know best-practices and see some tips for improving the usability of your 3d application.\nThe talk ends with my advice on how to create responsible applications, that won’t harm your users – neither physically nor psychologically.",

    "description": "PayPal Checkout with React Native by Poornima Venkatakrishnan of PayPal\n\nTalk Abstract\nThis talk is a technical deep-dive of how we use react-native as a means to deliver Checkout experience in our open sourced Paypal SDK. It will also layout how react-native has given us the power to steer without merchants having to reintegrate and republish with every incremental SDK release.\nTalk Description\nWhy ?\n‘Pay with Paypal’ is an option many of us use while shopping online . While Paypal has a solid web experience, we are still experimenting a good solve for the mobile ecosystem. Since we aim for stellar experiences we will need to iterate and learn quickly by A/B testing. But at the same time we need to be mindful of not having to force our merchants to continuously upgrade Paypal SDKs and publish updates on the app store. After some research/ investigation into options, we decided to build our SDK using react-native.\nHow ?\nThe SDK will be a native shell which will place a react-native root view into the Merchants View Controller that is initializing the Paypal SDK. This root view acts as a seed to initialize Paypal experiences. Whenever the react root view is initialized, we will pull down a checkout react-native bundle from the cloud which will host the payment experience within. When the SDK detects that a Paypal payment is initiated, the react-native layer is informed and it hosts the appropriate experience to complete the Payment (either opens a SFVC with the right mobile optimized web experience or natively put up a Paypal Pay sheet modal). Once the Payment is complete we close out the react-native hosted experience and the native shell places the merchant app in the right state, post payment. By this, we could sandbox and control the Paypal payment experience we host within the react-native layer, without interfering with the merchant app’s workflow. And the Paypal SDK integration will be a one-time easy process for the merchants !\nNotes\nStatus of the Mobile Paypal Checkout SDK\nThis is an ongoing R & D project and we have our initial open sourced SDKs here. The plan is to iterate on experiences independent of our merchants on-boarding process to integrate into the SDKs. We are actively working with merchants to onboard them onto this.\nhttps://github.com/paypal/paypalnativecheckout-docs https://github.com/paypal/paypalcheckout-ios https://github.com/paypal/paypalcheckout-android",

    "description": "React + ES.Next by Ben Ilegbodu of Eventbrite\n\nTalk Abstract\nDiscover how to leverage the new JavaScript language features and apply them to our React Native project.\nTalk Description\nJavaScript is evolving quickly. The ES6 specification was released back in 2015 and has been implemented by modern browsers. New versions of ECMAScript will now be released on a yearly basis. We can leverage ES6 and functionality slated for future versions right now to write even clearer and more concise React code.\nExperience with React will help you get the most out of this session, but you don’t have to have a JavaScript black belt to leave feeling confident in using ES.next with React. Learn how to write cleaner code using the new spread operator, classes, modules, destructuring, and other tasty syntactic sugar features being introduced into ECMAScript. Oh, and don’t worry if you don’t understand all of those terms — you soon will after this session!\nNotes\nThe goal of this talk is to walk React / React Native developers who aren’t familiar with new ECMAScript through some of its cool new features (including proposed new ones). But it’s more than just learning ES6+. It’s about how we can apply it (as well as future versions of ECMAScript) with React to write clearer and more succinct code. We’ll start off with React’s previous official tutorial that is 100% ES5 and slowly transform it using various ES6 and proposed future ECMAScript features that are transpiled via Babel. I developed a Github repo that is a step-by-step example of how to leverage ES6+/ES2015+ in React by rewriting (an adapted version of) the official React tutorial.\nECMAScript 2015 is JavaScript. React added support for native ES6 classes over a year ago (with v0.13), but there is still lots of developers still writing in ES5. Many coding examples and StackOverflow answers are given in ES6 so it’s important for us in the React community to level up.\nOutline:\nQuick React explanation\nQuick ECMAScript explanation\nModules\nClasses\nDestructuring\nArray + object spread (object.assign)\nObject rest parameters\nArrow functions\nBlock scoping (Let & const)\nPromise (w/ fetch api)\nComputed object literal properties with class names\nArray api additions\nDefault parameters",

    "description": "Gestures Here. Gestures There. Gestures Everywhere! by Kyle Poole & Thomas Bruketta of Instrument\n\nTalk Abstract\nThis talk digs into building rich touch interactions with React Native. There’s a deeper level than Touchable* components and PanResponders. Kyle and Thomas will uncover it, and show off its full potential!\nTalk Description\nTouchable* components and PanResponder add the magic of touch to your React Native app. They are great for building basic interactions, but to build more complex ones, we need a deeper understanding of how gestures work in React Native.\nThis talk peels back the layers of React Native’s gesture system, from higher level abstractions like Touchable*, to PanResponder, and finally to the thing powering it all: the Responder system. We’ll go through some of the more simple gestures, then showcase the full potential with custom ones, including bubbling and capture from multiple components. And with our demo app, the audience will be able to interact along with us. When attendees leave our session, they’ll feel empowered, not intimidated, by the many configuration options in (Pan)Responder. Equipped with a deeper understanding of gestures in React Native, they’ll be able to build immersive, rich touch interactions for their apps.\nNotes\nKyle Poole and Thomas Bruketta will co-present this talk. This dynamic duo has been crafting React Native applications at Instrument (here in Portland) over the last year for global clients. Both developers are contributors to the React Native open source community and Kyle Poole has created a collection of React Native primitives called Constelation that are a part of our team’s daily workflow .",

    "description": "Rewriting a Large Hybrid App with React Native by Javier Cuevas of Gudog\n\nTalk Abstract\nIn this talk we’ll share Gudog’s experience on rewriting our large Ionic / Cordova hybrid mobile app with React Native (using Ignite, redux, redux-saga & normalizr).\nTalk Description\nGudog is a p2p marketplace that connect dog owners and dog sitters in Europe. Our product is nearly as complex as other p2p marketplaces such as Airbnb in terms of features and numbers of screens.\nOur first mobile app was built in 2015 with Ionic (Angular.js based framework for building hybrid Cordova / Phonegap apps). This year we decided to rewrite it from scratch using React Native. We’ll share the reasons why we made some decisions regarding our new app and how we have layout our new architecture.\nAs newcomers to RN as we were, one of the problems we face was the lack of RN / Redux examples for complex apps, i.e. more than 5 or 10 screens. We hope that by sharing our experience we can help others overcome this.\nNotes\nI still have to detail a little bit more the outline of the talk. Any feedback from you guys on what could be interesting for the audience would be appreciated!\nPS: keep rockin’ Ignite v2!\nAdditional Information\nYour Request\nIf selected to speak and you have already purchased tickets, you will be reimbursed for your ticket via the ticket medium.

    "description": "Breaking Down Bridging in React Native by Peggy Rayzis of Major League Soccer\n\nTalk Abstract\nCrossing the bridge between native and JavaScript code can seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to be! This talk will simplify the process of bridging native modules & components by breaking down common patterns found in bridging implementations for iOS & Android.\nTalk Description\nWhether you’re integrating a brownfield native application, an existing native component, or a third-party SDK into your React Native project, you will eventually have to cross the bridge between native code and JavaScript. This process can definitely be intimidating, especially if you’re coming from a JavaScript background. In my talk, I will demystify the bridging process by exposing common patterns and best practices for bridging native components and modules. To simplify bridging concepts, I will show you how to use react-native-create-bridge, a CLI that auto-generates native module & component templates in Obj-C, Swift, and Java. You’ll also learn how to communicate between native modules and JS code by properly utilizing eventDispatcher (iOS) and DeviceEventEmitter (Android). By the end of this talk, you’ll leave feeling confident enough in the fundamental concepts of bridging to build a native component or module and use it in your React Native app.",

The problem is that `div` and `span` are a hidden dependency on `react-dom`, and similarly, React Native's `View` is an explicit dependency on Native, making both not quite as \"cross-platform\" as we want them to be. Learn how we as a community can get around these issues, and what we can unlock by doing so.",

The data for the services will be retrieving from DynamoDB tables which will be also be orchestrated via the framework. We will also talk briefly about authentication in React Native with AWS Cognito and how it can be setup as an auth solution for storing and accessing user data in Cognito attributes as well as data stored in DynamoDB and S3.\nNotes\nThe focus will be on delivering the data via an AWS Lambda written in Node.js using the Serverless framework for automation and accessing from React Native. Additional service interaction as mentioned above will be added for demo purposes.\nAWS Lambda’s are containerized functions run to perform compute and then destroyed. They are used to deliver the data for a users’ request directly from the AWS Lambda or via AWS API Gateway.",

Together we will look at how to evaluate when native code is the better choice. I’ll cover strategies for dealing with performance issues and how to handle background tasks like geolocation.\nTalk Description\nThe promise of writing an app in Javascript for iOS and having it “just work” out of the box on Android is a tempting one. That along with hot reloading and the ability to push over the air updates to published apps make React Native a tempting proposition, especially for web developers who are unfamiliar with native development and want to leverage their knowledge of React.\nHowever certain use-cases still require native code. Together we will take a look at some of these exceptions and how to evaluate when native code is the better choice out of necessity or performance concerns.\nThis talk will be from the perspective of an experienced iOS developer who has been working with React Native and has shipped several cross platform apps with native components.\nThings I will talk about:\nOverview of how React Native works\nOverview of iOS/Android application states and how that effects your apps design\nApp use-cases that require native code\nExample app with native code that uses geolocation in the background (code available on github)\nHow to use native tools to profile your app (with example app, available on github)\nStrategies for dealing with performance issues\nCooking demo where I port a Javascript component to Native and show differences in performance (code available on github)",

This talk will focus on distilling all of those requirements into actionable, easy to follow steps that you can use to deliver your next app.\nWe’ll do this by examining an app crafted specifically for this talk, which you can use throughout the conference!\nNotes\nFirst and foremost, here’s what will make this talk great: I want to create an app specifically for Chain React Conf that allows users to take photos of anything and everything going on. To make this even better, I would like to partner with a designer at Infinite Red to provide 1-3 photo frames to choose when taking a photo that has the conference branding.\nThe current plan is to have the app leverage Firebase via Firestack to allow for real-time updates. Due to how the app would be used, this talk is best suited for early in the conference lineup to get people using it.

    "description": "Design systems -collections of common components, colors, and other constants- are a key way to scale teams and web applications on the modern web. They're particularly handy for deduplicating frontend development costs for micro frontends and remote teams. But how do you create one from scratch -- or, much more commonly, in-flight from an existing service?\n\nWorkshop description:\nThis hands-on workshop will take you through three stages of crafting your design system:\nPart 1 (Design): Extracting colors, spacing, and typography from your existing brand. We'll look at an example site that has a rough collection of variant UIs, and trim the variants down to a consolidated set.\nPart 2 (Design+Dev): Creating components following standard Atomic Design using the first day's designs. We'll cover atoms, molecules, and so on, match the design sets to their categories, and implement them in a React + CSS variables design system.\nPart 3 (Design+Dev): Fleshing out components and documenting usage with Storybook and TypeScript. Now that we have our basic design system, let's go one by one and swap out the preexisting components and designs on the site!\n\nPre-requisites\n\nIntermediate React and CSS knowledge.",

From static HTML files to dynamic server-generated HTML responses. Then to REST or GraphQL APIs consumed by JavaScript-heavy clients with the Jamstack. The web is entering a completely new transformation. Modern infrastructure and techniques have changed the rules of what it means to make an excellent user experience. In this new future, what's old is new and what's modern is lacking.\n\nIn this keynote, Kent C. Dodds will show you how this transformation will impact your user experience, your development productivity, and your business goals. The future of the web is distributed. It's faster. It's cheaper. It's exciting. Kent will show you what you can do to stay in front of it (and no, it's not web3).\n\n@KentCDodds-vids",

    "description": "Hooks have become a better and cleaner way to write React code. Many have realized it and migrated their solutions from class to functional components. When the code looks great, and the migration seems successful, your tests may disagree.\n\nThis presentation focuses on the common pitfalls of testing and what we have been doing wrong while also teaching you how to test your brand new hooks using components, all this while using the React Testing Library.\n\nI’ve been advocating for better testing practices using the Testing Library and have occasionally contributed to it. After spending months of refactoring implementation details focused tests, I’ve grown to understand the main pain points of testing React components and helped my team to build new practices and write better performant and resistant tests.\n\nThis talk consists of a real-life story of when at a previous company, we decided to migrate our 4 months old application from class components to functional ones and use React Hooks. It approaches the motivations for this migration (code reusability, code readability and the ease of teaching React to future Junior hires) and focuses on the main pain point we had: More than half of our tests failed.\n\n\nOur tests were strongly focused on implementation details. This talk will approach how we dealt with this, and, how we discovered the React Testing Library.\n\n\nDaniel is a Developer Advocate at OLX Group. His current interest is in React and JavaScript, and he advocates for better testing principles using the testing library. He has a full-stack background, having worked with different languages and frameworks on various projects from IoT to Fraud Detection. In his free time, when he's not learning new technologies or writing about them, he's probably reading comics or watching superhero movies and shows.",

    "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_fKdyWwdfTk/sddefault.jpg",
    "description": "Forms are one of the most common and important parts of any web app. A poorly optimized form can cause a jarring experience to the user who is trying to fill it because of the lags and slow feedback times. Unfortunately, most React tutorials online suggest using state to store data of the form fields and change them on every keystroke. This is kind of shooting yourself on the foot because as the form grows, the state updates also increase causing unwanted re-renders which end up slowing your UI.\n\nThis is a problem I faced in one of my projects where the form was very large and had poor feedback time because it was causing wasted re-renders. I found the solution to this problem was using uncontrolled form fields and using a library like react-hook-form that makes it easy to use uncontrolled form fields without giving up on reactive features.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll be showing how to build a similar API to react-hook-form that leverages uncontrolled form fields to considerably improve the performance of a React form. The best part is that this approach also does not give up on reactivity features a form might need on input change while still providing an easy and ergonomic API.",

    "description": "Design System is a set of shared and integrated principles and patterns, to reduce redundancy and make standardised product that define the overall design of a product.\n\nWhy do we need design system?\n- Maintaining their product is easy.\n- Maintaining the team and other operations around product is standardised in terms for development and design.\n- to save time in development processes\n\nBenefits of having a design system:\n- Promotes consitency.\n- High efficiency\n- Easy updation\n- Open for innovation of whole product.\n- Good UX\n\nWhat are the things that design system should include?\n- brand values, brand identity, components, patterns, assets, etc.\n\nWhile building a design system creating tool, there was a huge learning in terms of how a brand uses the design system, how their developers develop the product, how different designers design. The work was more of reasearch than actually developing the tool.\n\nFollowing are the key learnings and points that I kept in mind:\n1. There should be a balance between the restriction of customizibility and and following the design system rules.\n2. How to make designing easy for UX.\n3. Design sharability.\n4. Ease of using the Design System created from the tool.\n\nDesign system is a very generic and vast term which solves designing and developing the product at the same time.\n\n\nThere should be a sync and a single truth of all the files needed to design and develop a product and design system definitely solves that. While creating a design system, design system can provide and steps and code snippets to build the same. While we get the design and code from a single source, the product looks more formalised and it saves a time for both developers and designers and the tool acts like a communication tool.\n\nHigh level problems:\n- Issues while designing it for different platform environments\n- making it easy UX wise and more like a no code tool.\n- Adding more complex components into a design system and then customizing them.\n- Supporting third party library components in a design system works on a particular tech stack.\n\nWhen and How to build a design system and use it efficiently?\n\nWhen:\n\nThe company needs to evaluate its growth and the scalability factor while going for the design system.\nA design system is a good idea when the software product has a lot of screens and the design standards are unmatchable. A componany or a brand needs to evaluate the time and maintainability while choosing a design system idea.\n\nHow:\nIf you are in the starting phase of the company:\nIt is better to start off with a low level design system that scales up with the product. IT will definitely cut off the design cost later.\n\nIf you are on the enterprise level:\nThe concerned team needs to judge the existing designs of the company and need to evaluate that it doesn't changes the originality of the product. The process needs to very systematic when opting for a design system at later stage but it will definitely result is fruitful results in a longer run.\n\nMeenu is a front-end developer (JavaScript NERD stack) with a love for creativity and solving problems. You give her data and she will render it. She is one of the creators of NativeBase along with a lot of tiny tools to automate dev workflows.

    "description": "What if it was possible to build backend features for our react apps in the same way that we use redux in our react apps? In this live-coding demo, I will show you how we’ll add backend business logic using the redux abstractions of dispatching actions, writing reducers as pure functions and subscribing to updated state. Our backend will be completely serverless and using open-source and managed services so that we’re not actually deploying and maintaining any servers. We will use GraphQL mutations from our React app to dispatch actions. These will trigger serverless functions which are pure and return the modified state, which will be persisted safely on a cloud managed database. Portions of your app that are subscribed to the state using GraphQL subscriptions (live-queries) will automatically update! You will witness the raw awesomeness of being able to use JavaScript and GraphQL in a pattern that you are comfortable with to build backend features from scratch",

Companies like Facebook and Airbnb leverage OSS as a source of brand equity and recruiting, among other advantages. However, OSS is still uncomfortable for many companies — and even if they do open source their tools, these projects often fail to launch — because they’re missing the most important (and best) part of OSS: the community.Projects that survive in today’s landscape have thriving communities that care deeply about the quality and advancement of open source and the people using it. But open source can also be intimidating to newcomers, and occasionally unwelcoming. In this talk, learn how popular open source framework Gatsby has doubled down on community, including: 1. Offering open pair programming hours 2. Trusting all contributors with merge access 3. Sending free swag to contributors... And much more!

    "description": "About the session\nUnderstanding the new Suspense SSR architecture in React 18\n\nReact's server-side rendering (SSR) is preferred by many developers to improve performance & SEO. SSR involves 4 steps i.e. fetching your app data & rendering to HTML on the server and loading the JavaScript code & hydration on the client-side. Before React 18, each of these steps had to be completed one after other for the entire app. This could cause the bigger & slower part of your app to block the other parts, affecting the UX.Current optimisations in React 18 allow you to use Suspense to split your app into smaller parts that will go through these steps independently. Users can now view the content sooner and start interacting with it much faster.\n\n\nKirti Vernekar is a web developer and product design enthusiast. She love designing and building digital experiences. She is a huge believer in the idea of simplifying UI and maximising UX! When not juggling with tabs, She enjoy making 3D art and talking about fiction.",

    "description": "In this talk we will explore the concept of predictive prefetching and how it increases the web performance and INP(Interaction to Next Paint) score.\nAs we at 1mg always focus on enhancing user experience and setting new benchmarks for performance, we believe that by anticipating user actions and proactively fetching the necessary resources in advance, we can drastically improve the user experience and achieve performance similar to that of native applications.\n\nAs we built the prefetching module, we built it as a standalone library so that you can plug it into any project. Also we fine tuned the package to handle most of the things on its own like not fetching too many resources as it's a waste of user’s data bandwidth and clearing existing data fetching processes on user navigation. Optimize the prefetching process to work seamlessly across different devices and network conditions.\n\nWhat have we built:\n- Route prefetching package which you can integrate to any JS framework. This package accepts either the routes for which we want to prefetch bundles or direct link to the resource.\n- React hooks over the package to easily integrate with a React Project.\n- A webpack plugin which reads your projects routes file and generates routes(navigation links) to JS bundles mapping.

The strong decoupling of state and UI helps us to iterate on our UI more quickly. The architecture of the studio is pluggable and we will see how MobX helps integrating external producers and consumers of state into the product. In the end, we believe that this approach results in a code base that is sane and accessible. In which we get things done quickly.\n\nReactNext 2016\nTel Aviv, Israel",

It is a critical step in the creation and maintenance of code. No matter what it is that you are developing, you will undoubtedly have an array of issues, and debugging enables you to get to the bottom of these; to find the bug and to then find a fix for it.\n\nBut debugging, as we know it, is broken. It takes time, it is always a struggle to get the exact data you want, and worst of all, you are often called to debug at the most inconvenient times.\n\nIn this talk, we will delve into the reasons why debugging techniques are broken. Why a method that was developed last century is no longer relevant (or useful) to our ever evolving technology stacks of today, and what advances have been made in the space to ensure that everyone can use the right tools for the right use case. We will delve into the finer details of how tools empower teams to take real ownership and how, by addressing the biggest pain points associated with traditional debugging techniques, we can rebrand it to a task that developers would want to take on.\n\n\nElinor Sapir\nSolution Engineer\n\nElinor is the Director Solutions Engineering at Rookout.

They require complicated CSS and JavaScript fine-tuning, often involve state management, and can sometimes break at the slightest touch. They do make for a delightful user experience though, so they’re worth getting really good at\nThe View Transitions API provides us with a mechanism to manage animations in single page applications. This native API not only handles transitions, but effectively manages the DOM state change under the hood. And it’s customizable with some straightforward CSS.\nIn this talk we’ll look at how to use the View Transitions API using a demo app, and also take a bit of a dive into how this works under the hood.\n\n\nNetta Bondy\nSenior Front End Developer\n\nNetta is a senior front end developer and a lover of all things JavaScript.

This method allows developers to write intuitive and linear business logic, akin to using if (await dialog(\"question\")) {...} for handling user inputs, streamlining the process of complex user flows and decision trees within applications.\n\n\nNoam Honig\nCreator of Remult\n\nCoder, open-sourcerer, developer experience enthusiast, software architect, and entrepreneur.

In this presentation, we challenge the conventional practice of purging old code. We will explore how our team's seemingly counterintuitive decision to stop deleting old codepaths has not only streamlined our React development process but has also acted as an unforeseen safety net in times of crisis. In other words, our laziness became a wellspring of real-time resilience.\nJoin this session to explore how an embrace of relics in the code can enhance resilience, expedite recovery, and provide unexpected solutions to the challenges faced by front-end developers using the React framework. Gain insights into how this unorthodox strategy not only provides unexpected solutions, but also transforms old code flows from a perceived liability into an invaluable asset.\n\nNoam Tahor Shafran\nEngineering Manager @ Remitly \n\nNoam began her journey with Remitly 4.5 years ago as a junior front-end developer and quickly evolved professionally. Today, she leads a team of full-stack developers in charge of the Rewire by Remitly financial platform.

The more it expands, the heavier it gets with larger bundle sizes, dependencies multiplying, and the overall complexity going through the roof. And let's face it, it's a headache when every project using the library ends up dragging the entire package, even when they just need a single component 🤦.\nBut worry not! That's where tree-shaking steps in to save the day!\nIn this talk, I will spill the beans on my experience fine-tuning a React component library that boasts over 40 components and serves various projects. We'll roll up our sleeves and dig into the world of tree shaking, talk about what you need to get it up and running smoothly and untangle some tricky terms like commonJS vs. ES modules, peer dependencies, and the whole multi-bundle exports thing.\nGet ready for some down-to-earth, practical insights that can save you a refactor or two.\n\n\nAsaf Shochet Avida\nFrontend Tech Lead @ Evinced\n\nAsaf is the front-end tech lead @Evinced, with 13+ years of experience under his belt, including frontend, backend, and test automation (go testing!), and a special place in his heart for shiny CI pipelines.\nHe loves reading Harry Potter with his daughter, mentoring junior devs, and making bonfires with his family.",

    "description": "ReactNext\nwww.react-next.com\nIsrael's Annual React & React Native confernce\n@reactnext \n\nMigrating from state management to react-query. I’m sorry, what?!\n\nIt’s time to admit - we were wrong. State management solutions are great, but unfitting for server-side data. Server-side data needs special care, like async behaviour built-in, caching, deduping, refetching, loading states, error states, pagination, and more. And us - we kept struggling with state management solutions and re-invented the wheel.\n\nThe good news is that now we have react-query. And even better - we have hooks, so combining server and client state is easier than ever.\n\nLet’s explore this new architecture based on react-query, together, and learn how we can benefit from its flexibility and simplicity.\n\nAdam Klein\nCo-founder & CTO @ Covver\nAdam is the CTO of Covver, a web GDE, and author of open source libraries.

    "description": "ReactNext \nwww.react-next.com\n Israel's Annual React & React Native conference \n@reactnext\n\nCreating production-ready infrastructure for your React app in 30 minutes or less\n\nWith so many different technologies, we have a strong tendency to overcomplicate our development process. It’s natural - after all, it stems from our need to deliver quickly despite the pressure. Unfortunately, this misguided approach significantly slows down development instead of speeding it up, delays delivery and causes us to waste valuable resources on trial and error.\n\nIn this talk we’ll demonstrate an applicable, streamlined approach for creating production-ready infrastructure to help your developers focus on code and business logic rather than wasting their time.\n\nWe will start from scratch, and write and deploy an application to production. Using React and a monorepo approach, we will learn how to spin up everything a startup needs to launch a hyperscale product.\n\nThis talk is designed for attendees who are early in their cloud native journey - you will walk out with more knowledge of production ready clusters, and greater comfort in product deployment.\n\nAlon Valadji\nAlon is a leading software architect well-versed in Rozansky and Woods’ architectural methodologies.

But over time the project grows and changes, and everything doesn't always stay up to date. Now you have a few cobwebs 🕸 on some parts of your codebase that you cringe 😅 at when you come across them!\n\nThis is a totally normal part of the natural growth of an application. But how can we tackle those smells and correct past mistakes without massively blowing out the scope 🤔?\n\nLet's discuss a generic approach to incrementally improve many aspects of our codebases! We will take some ideas from genetic algorithms and micro-service architectures, and combine them with code analysis and snapshot testing, and introduce a pragmatic, *evolutionary* approach to codebase health and maintenance.\n\nCraig Spence\nSenior Engineer @ Spotify \nCraig is a Software Engineer from New Zealand, working at Spotify in Stockholm.

    "description": "ReactNext \nwww.react-next.com \nIsrael's Annual React & React Native conference \n@reactnext\n\nHow We Introduced Automated Web App Testing in A Large Organization\n\nMany organizations struggle with building a reliable set of automated tests for their React web applications. Yet a set of manual test plans is not an answer; testing without automation is slow, gives low confidence in the software, and the test results provide little actionable feedback to the developers. Should we just write unit and component tests using Jest? You must be joking - these tests are definitely not enough to ensure the app works. In this presentation, I describe how a large company has built a comprehensive automated set of end-to-end and component test suites after two previous unsuccessful attempts. I will show how to build trust between the QA engineers and front-end developers, how to convince other stake holders that investing time in testing is important, and how to balance the different types of tests: e2e, component, unit, and api to cover both the happy paths and the edge cases.\n\nGleb Bahmotov\nVP of Engineering at Mercari\nGleb Bahmutov is JavaScript ninja, image processing expert and software quality fanatic.

    "description": "ReactNext \nwww.react-next.com\n Israel's Annual React & React Native conference \n@reactnext\n\nFrontend Microservices: Unravelling Spaghetti Code\n\nBackend microservices have enabled large companies like Google, Facebook, and Wix to scale their development teams to thousands of developers, while still maintaining the agility of small startups. The secret? Modularity and code isolation that enable teams to develop and deploy microservices independently of one another.\n\nMicrofrontends are the realization of this in the frontend. While the backend has consensus on how to architect microservices, the frontend is still in the experimentation phase. In this talk, I will describe how Roundforest does microfrontends, in a way that translates microservices to a natural and logical frontend architecture that makes sense on the web.\n\nGil Tayar\nSenior Software Architect at Roundforest\n\n35 years of experience have not dulled the fascination Gil Tayar has with software development. His passion is distributed systems and figuring out how to scale development to big teams. Extreme modularity and testing are the main tools in his toolbelt, using them to combat the code spaghetti monster at companies like Wix, Applitools, and at his current job as software architect at Roundforest.\n\nIn his private life, he is a dad to two lovely kids (and a cat), an avid reader of Science Fiction, (he counts Samuel Delany, Robert Silverberg, and Robert Heinlein as favorites) and a passionate film buff. (Stanley Kubrick, Lars Von Trier, David Cronenberg, anybody?)\n\nUnfortunately for him, he hasn’t answered the big question of his life—what’s better, static or dynamic languages?

The most difficult part of automated testing on mobile is the tip of the testing pyramid – E2E. The core problem with E2E tests is flakiness – tests are usually not deterministic. React Native makes flakiness worse due to the async nature of the bridge. We believe the only way to tackle flakiness head on is by moving from blackbox testing to graybox testing and that’s where detox comes into play. The library synchronizes with the lifecycle of the app, including React Native core, making tests finally deterministic.\n\nReactNext 2017\nTel Aviv, Israel",

Yet, there’s a limit to the magic that even React can pull off. There are times we need to help it, and often we might actually hurt the performance of our applications.\n\nIn this talk I will do a live demo of investigating and resolving performance issues such as how immutable state' can actually adversely affect performance or how inefficient selectors can lead to components unnecessarily re-rendering. Using the Chrome Dev Tools and other profiling tools provided by React itself, we will discover how to find what's causing slowdowns. Then we'll go through the best practices needed to make our app blazing fast again.\n\nYoav Niran, Senior Frontend Developer @ Cloudinary\nI’m passionate about Technology, Software Engineering, Basketball and all things Science and Sci-Fi.

It doesn't require learning new data structures or update APIs, but instead creates a temporarily shadow tree which can be modified using the standard JavaScript APIs. The shadow tree will be used to generate your next immutable state tree. This shadow tree is maintained using Proxies.\n\nProxies are an exotic javascript feature that is nowadays available in all modern browsers. What are they, how do they work and why should you (not) use them?\n\nJoin this talk to learn more about Proxies, or about how to deal with immutability data structures with a better DX as was ever possible so far.

However, what we keep finding, again and again, is that for most of the cases. Writing better performant react code can fix our performance issues. In the last couple of years our team built a huge production app in react native.\n\nIn this talk I’ll go over some of our lessons learned in regards of react native performance and how to improve your app’s performance subsequently.\n\nHi I'm Ofir, an R&D manager at WIX.com. In the last few years I've worked a lot with react and angular and developed wix's dashboard from scratch. Over the last two years I’ve been leading the Wix CRM Mobile team, writing wix’s mobile app in react native and now I'm leading the Wix Chat group. I'm also a mentor at WIX Academy (WIX's training program) and I love speaking about software in all of its forms. Besides programming, I'm an adrenaline enthusiastic.

I want to show these technics, building a real world react app, using storybook, with DDD (design-driven development) and atomic design. \n\nBuilding an app is a complicated task. It starts with the flow from the product moving to design and then to the RND. However, it does not stop there, there is a need to go back and forth with the process as specs and design might change. Using DDD, we can leverage the ability to describe the spec visually, for the product and other stakeholders.\n\nUsing atomic design, we can create our MVP fast and ready for scale.

    "description": "ReactNext 2019\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n@reactnext\n\nRedux-sagas became a pretty common tool to handle asynchronous actions in the react-redux ecosystem. However, often I saw that not all asynchronous events are handled with it although redux-sagas have event channels which allow you to listen and react to any asynchronous routine (e.g. socket connections or external signals) and not just redux actions. \n\nExpect some live coding in this talk: We will implement a redux-saga event channel to catch signals of bluetooth beacons (why on earth do I try a hardware live demo!). Besides, this talk want to strengthen your understanding of generator functions (the backbone of redux-sagas). To this end, we will dive into a naive implementation of async-await to understand generator functions, and as a result, redux-sagas better.\n\nAs a freelancer software engineer, André builds and improves React and React Native apps. In his projects he often introduces new tools and puts an emphasis on clean code. He worked a lot with bluetooth beacon technology and created a popular open-source library in this field. As data scientist he digs through data and tries to discover interesting relations. You can often find André at hackathons, which he already successfully participated in 19 times.

It's time to formally model our forms. In this talk, we'll explore the current React form landscape and learn how hooks and state machines can be used to create abstract models of complex forms that greatly reduce dependencies on restrictive form libraries or complex custom components. With these abstract models, form logic can be automatically tested, simulated, analyzed, and visualized.\n\nDavid Khourshid is a software engineer for Microsoft, a tech author, and speaker.

If you're used to web, dealing with mobile-specific deployment issues can be a struggle. There are native build hardware and config requirements, signing certificates, app store approvals, app versions, pushing updates, and more. You also have to consider all the tooling options -- do you manually deploy on your own, use a React Native-specific solution, or try to configure web CI/CD for mobile?

Aspects like structuring and organizing your codebase, code sharing across teams, speeding up build and test runs can play a huge role in terms of productivity for a developer team. Those aspects impact small teams but get even more evident as your team grows and especially for large enterprises. \nIn this talk, I will show you how to avoid a monolithic codebase, how to modularize your React app and how that might even help you speed up your CI builds: thus help you scale development as your team grows. We'll be doing this in a very concrete and practical way, using Nx as our toolkit.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

Survey Monkey’s best-in-class digital products were being held back by fragmentation and complexity, which created a lot of rework and wasted effort for their engineering teams. Working together, we implemented a number of process and architecture changes that cut the complexity and improved workflows, letting our blended team deliver results with speed and consistently, even early in the engagement. These were not one-size-fits-all solutions, but solves that were unique and fitted to the needs of the engineering and product teams. The success of the project was due to Survey Monkey’s motivated teams that were: 1) Ready to embrace change; 2) Able to keep a firm focus on the outcomes; and 3) Readily understood the complexity of the project.\nThis allowed us to co-create some non-intuitive solutions that engineers at similar enterprise-level companies should know about.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

As your web application grows to a global audience, multilingual functionality becomes increasingly essential. So, how do you design your code such that it is flexible enough to include all of your international users? In this talk, we will explore what it means and what it looks like to build a React app that supports internationalization (i18n). You will learn several different strategies for locale-proofing your application with React contexts and custom hooks.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

As teams and projects scale, and technologies change over time, being able to provide a universal component library as a design system for an entire organization proves to be difficult.\n\nStencil was created to help address this issue, most notably for Ionic, which is a UI library for mobile app development using web-technologies. In this talk we’ll walk through how Ionic is able to create an Ionic React library, using custom elements (web components) as the lowest level. Using the Stencil compiler, the Ionic team is able to generate various bindings for each of the frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.\n\n\nThe benefit of this allows the design team to focus on maintaining one codebase, while the Stencil compiler does the heavy lifting to generate the various output targets. Additionally, end-users of each framework binding get to interact with their traditional component model they’re familiar with. React developers use @ionic/react no differently than any other React component, and the same goes for Angular and Vue.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

As new engineering teams continued to spin up new frontend microservices, our custom-built platform grew increasingly fragmented. This led to more headaches for our teams, who were struggling to keep up with maintenance patches and security updates. What could we do to get ourselves out of this mess?\n\nCome join us as we discuss how we built a new platform with Next.js at its core to solve the challenges we faced. With the momentum of the Next.js community, we were able to extend this framework with a unique plugin architecture that allowed our engineers to hot-swap new packages and tools while allowing us to upgrade entire swaths of the stack at once. At the same time, we've multiplied the productivity (and happiness) of every frontend engineer at Lyft. We'll end with some great things to share that can be taken with you to address the challenges you face scaling your own frontend platforms!\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

In an age of ever-increasing cybersecurity threats, more and more software companies are shying away from undertaking these high levels of responsibility and liability.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll see how to build a user authentication system in react using magic, where magic provides a key-based identity solution built on top of the Decentralized Identity (DID) standard, where users’ identities are self-sovereign by leveraging blockchain public-private key pairs. These key pairs are used to generate zero-knowledge proofs to authenticate users instead of having to rely on users providing passwords to Magic or any identity provider.\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

Being able to learn and predict the behavior of users has many powerful applications, one of them is the chance to boost the UI performance by prefetching code & resources before the user reaches them. In this talk, we describe a high-level implementation of an intelligent prefetcher, using ReactJS and TensorFlow.js. We use neural networks to learn the user's behaviour, and leverages React's lazy-loading API to prefetch components according to predictions. There is a chance for Frontend developers to explore the powerful combination of UI and AI.\n\n\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\n\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\nAWS Amplify  → https://docs.amplify.aws/\nWP Engine → https://wpengine.com/\nShopify → https://shopify.engineering/\nRangle → https://rangle.io/\n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nRollbar → https://rollbar.com/product/\nMUX → https://mux.com/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/\nMicrosoft → https://aka.ms/devopsjsfm\nStoryblok → https://www.storyblok.com/\nCloudinary → https://cloudinary.com/ \nCleo → https://www.meetcleo.com/ \nPrismic → https://prismic.io/  \nG2i  → https://www.g2i.co/\nNetlify → https://www.netlify.com/\nDataDog → https://www.datadoghq.com/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nKontent → https://kontent.ai/\nMagic → https://magic.link/\nAldeia → https://aldeia.world/\nNacelle → https://nacelle.com/\nInfluxdata → https://www.influxdata.com/\nProgress KendoReact → https://www.telerik.com/\nNeo4j→https://neo4j.com/\nTara → https://tara.ai/",

Technology will continue to evolve and change, and developers will continue to rewrite applications. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could just copy paste 90% of our code from framework to framework?\nWell, you can. Reactive programming enables just this AND the ability to future proof your code.\nNot only can reactive programming help with your solutions to JavaScript fatigue, but the concepts and technology remain consistent from framework to framework.\nLearn how to create a more composable application architecture and an arsenal of lego bricks with RxJS, a push based primitive and domain specific language that sits on top of JavaScript.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Flux or MVC or MVVM? Redux, MobX or Apollo? Instead of answering the question, in this talk we will look at JavaScript code on a more fundamental level: How do data structures work in JavaScript. What assumptions can be we make if we treat them to be immutable? Or mutable? How can we express concepts like identities, references, collections, mutations, derivations in either case? And can we bent the rules between the two? This talk will provide you a deeper understanding of the difference between state and data. A deeper understanding of JavaScript itself. Which will help you to improve the state you manage, regardless of the library you use to implement that.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

The complicated data manipulation, the validation, the process flow of our apps. In other words, the business logic. If React is designed for the view layer, and we’re using Redux or something similar for the state, then where does the business logic go? This talk looks at the different options and tries to answer that question.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Styling? Got it. Animations? A little different, but sure. Now let's add a navigation bar and another screen that we transition to...\nThis is where you hit a fork in the road. You can either use a library that wraps the native navigation APIs for the platform or a re-implementation of those APIs using the same React Native primitives (View, Text, Animated, etc) that you use throughout your app. The former is commonly called “native navigation\" because most of the implementation is in \"native\" and the latter is called \"JavaScript-based navigation\" because most of the implementation is in JavaScript. React Navigation is a \"JavaScript-based\" navigation solution and React Native Navigation is a \"native\" navigation library. The choice you make has a significant impact on your app, and it's something you will live with every day while you continue to work on the project.\nI lead the React Navigation along with the creator of the project, Eric Vicenti. I'll explain why we think that building a JavaScript-based navigation library is important, what the limitations are (why there is room for both categories of solutions), and I'll show you how to take full advantage of it.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

After all, React’s whole purpose is managing updates to the DOM so we don’t have to. D3, on the other hand, is a library for building data visualizations, and it too needs access to the DOM. And stepping back, when should we even use D3 and React together? In this talk, I will give guidelines on when React should have ownership of the DOM, and when D3 should instead. More importantly, I will cover the interactions and applications that will benefit the most from using D3 and React, together.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Over the years companies and developers have invested a lot of time and money in development of UI components based on VanillaJS or various frameworks. Building components is time consuming, has integration and maintenance risks, and worst of all, distracts developers from the task at hand - actually building the application. In this presentation, you will learn how to quickly and easily “Reactify” your existing JavaScript components to use them in React applications.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

That is, completely different from what we have used to be doing - when writing imperative code. In fact, imperative itself is often blamed on Twitter for being highly dangerous and an anti-pattern. In this talk, we will explore different ways of building reusable libraries with React Native (like APIs and higher order components). We will see that imperative code is actually there at low-level and is what makes communication with native world possible.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In my talk I'll be talking about how to achieve this feature with React Native for both iOS and Android.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Scaling this project requires code architecture that enables each module to be developed separately, but easily fit the big puzzle.\nWe’ll discuss the way we do both unit and E2E testing, the way we scale our CI, the way we deploy and how we fix issues in production when they arise.\nWe’ll also share our plans to how we’re going to scale our app and dev process to support 100 developers a year from today.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

It’s a lean wrapper around OpenGL and WebGL and allows truly cross-platform games to be written rather easily.\nReason is great for a whole lot of things, but let me take you through a story of trying to write a 2D physics engine in just under 8 hours (Mistakes were made), what strongly typed languages don’t protect you off, and a vision of what you could build with Reason or Reprocessing. The universal future is coming, and Reason is orienting itself just right with projects like bsb-native.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalised, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like prototypes.\n\nAt Mendix these restrictions where unacceptable and so MobX was born. MobX makes state management simple again by addressing the root issue: it makes it impossible to produce an inconsistent state. This makes state management simple and scalable again.\n\nSlides are https://speakerdeck.com/reactamsterdam/michel-weststrate-mendix-rotterdam-state-management-is-easy\n\nIf you tweet, don't forget to #reactamsterdam tag it!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In this talk we will get a glimpse into the future where we will control apps with our thoughts. Literally. It’s not a thought experiment, but a journey into our brainwaves with consumer EEG headset. We will explore how we can use them and AI to create futuristic experiences, which will lay a foundation stone to our future interactions with the digital world.\n\nVladimir Novick\nIndependent Consultant, engineer and trainer, Google Developer Expert, worldwide speaker and published author.

Many developers swear by the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) philosophy while others prefer to Write Everything Twice (WET). But which of these produces more maintainable codebases? I've seen both of these approaches lay waste to codebases and I have a new ideology I would like to propose to you: Avoid Hasty Abstractions (AHA). In this keynote, we'll talk about abstraction and how you can improve a codebase by applying and creating abstractions more thoughtfully as well as how to get yourself out of a mess of over or under-abstraction.\n\nKent C.

Teams need to share core functionality while staying autonomous. Changes need to propagate through many projects while being tested. [Nx](https://nx.dev/) is an open-source toolkit that allows organizations to scale development more easily than before! Nx makes setting up Cypress, Prettier, Storybook, Next.js, and Gatsby faster than ever. You can also develop full-stack by using Node frameworks like Apollo and Nest.js and share code between frontend and backend. In this talk you’ll learn how large organizations like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google are able to successfully scale across multiple teams, business units, and products.\n\nJason Jean\nJason is an Architect at Nrwl on the Nx Core Team. He works with Fortune 500 companies across different industries to enable them to develop like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google. Along with development, Jason is also an enthusiast of board games and mechanical keyboards.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In this talk, you’ll get the lowdown on why most of your “global state” isn’t really state at all and how React Query can help you fetch, cache and manage your asynchronous data with a fraction of the effort and code that you’re used to.\n\n\nTanner Linsley\nTanner is an open source creator who loves React and JavaScript.

But why is that the case? How complicated is it to create a new release of React Native? Surely it looks similar to the release process you are using... or not!\nDuring this talk I'll walk you through the many steps and complexities involved in publishing a new version or React Native, and I'll challenge one fundamental idea – that 1.0 is the solution to all problems.\nI hope you're ready, it's going to be wild!\n\nLorenzo Sciandra\nLorenzo is a Software Engineer at Formidable UK — a few years ago he decided to use React Native for a project. He hasn’t stopped since: he became an Open Source maintainer for the core project, helping the Facebook team. He also cares a lot about mental health, so he decided to help his local OSS community with a dedicated meetup, ProvidedAsIs.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

New features need to be built that are sort of similar to features that already existed, but what bits they can reuse is not clear (eg: pagination). New members join the team and we’d like them to work on their UI components without worrying about the data fetching logic of the rest of the component tree. Relay takes an opinionated stance to solve some of these problems that are worth understanding and learning from.\nIn this talk, I'm going to motivate the core features in Relay from the ground-up. I'll do hands-on demos to explain the common challenges GraphQL clients run into, how one would fix them without Relay and then fix them with Relay. I'll also touch upon how Relay works and its design briefly and how Relay’s design goal is not just being a high-performance GraphQL client, but also increasing developer productivity and happiness.\n\nTanmai Gopal\nTanmai Gopal is the CEO, co-founder of Hasura.

In this lightning talk, I'll be showing you implementation differences between the behavior of native HTML elements and their DIV counterparts.\n\nJen Luker \nJen is a Sr. Frontend Engineer, conference speaker, and BookBytes podcast co-host. She has spent the majority of her career as a full-stack developer using PHP, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular fondness for frontend technologies. She is an advocate for both accessibility, and processes that make doing the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard. When she's not exploring solutions, learning new technologies, or reading, Jen's spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting; she's even been known to 3D print her own tools for the job. She is also fascinated by all things space, antique cars, and IoT.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

We use libraries to mock dependencies to test our code in isolation (e.g. services used in our React components). We take them for granted, assuming that they function correctly, probably by magic! Are mocking libraries “magic”?\n\nJoin Mattia to find out what libraries, such as Jest, are doing under the hood as you write your own mock testing library.\n\nAbout Mattia\nHe loves shell scripting; he literally lives in the terminal (that’s probably why he uses VIM). Other than getting his hands dirty with React, RxJS and Mobx, he is also passionate about cyber security and Motorbikes.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Since then we have discovered patterns on how to best structure and implement a GraphQL API. In this talk we will share some of these patterns and provide examples on how to implement them.\n\nLink to event page https://www.meetup.com/React-Amsterdam/events/237423993/\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Using open source tools like WPGraphQL and Atlas Content Modeler, you can transform your WordPress site into a powerful headless CMS that serves data via GraphQL. We’ll see how we can query for and use that data in a Remix app, and also discuss how the framework’s focus on web fundamentals can benefit both the developer and the visitors who use our sites.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\nAg Grid → https://www.ag-grid.com/\nToptal → https://www.toptal.com/freelance-jobs\nRangle.io → https://rangle.io/ \nWPEngine → https://wpengine.com/\nVodafone → https://careers.vodafone.com/ \n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nBitvavo → https://bitvavo.com/\nIonic → https://ionic.io/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\nKontent by Kentico → https://kontent.ai/\nDecentology → https://www.decentology.com/\nXata → https://xata.io/\nDocker → https://www.docker.com/\nShopify → https://www.shopify.com/careers\nWix Engineering → https://wix.com\nNearForm → https://www.nearform.com/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nSanity → https://www.sanity.io/\nSnyk → https://snyk.io/\nContentful → https://www.contentful.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nFirebase → https://firebase.google.com/\nCallstack → https://www.callstack.com/\nMercari → https://about.mercari.com/en/\nvpTech/ → https://careers.veepee.com/en/vptech-2/\nNativeBase → https://nativebase.io/\nStream → https://getstream.io/\nSiteGround → https://www.siteground.com/\nYoast → https://yoast.com/\nNovermber Five → https://www.novemberfive.co/\nTwilio → https://www.twilio.com/ahoy\nBCGDV → https://bcgdv.com/\nFullscript → https://fullscript.com/\nUtopia Music → https://utopiamusic.com/\nSISU → https://www.sisu.tools/",

Contentful is a well-known flexible headless CMS. Together are a great match, but when we talk large scale projects the challenges are completely different than the ones you may face in a small to medium scale project. Leonidas will try to raise your awareness on such challenges based on Greece's experience on redesigning Vodafone's site to create beautiful self-serve and guided journeys for Vodafone customers.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\nAg Grid → https://www.ag-grid.com/\nToptal → https://www.toptal.com/freelance-jobs\nRangle.io → https://rangle.io/ \nWPEngine → https://wpengine.com/\nVodafone → https://careers.vodafone.com/ \n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nBitvavo → https://bitvavo.com/\nIonic → https://ionic.io/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\nKontent by Kentico → https://kontent.ai/\nDecentology → https://www.decentology.com/\nXata → https://xata.io/\nDocker → https://www.docker.com/\nShopify → https://www.shopify.com/careers\nWix Engineering → https://wix.com\nNearForm → https://www.nearform.com/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nSanity → https://www.sanity.io/\nSnyk → https://snyk.io/\nContentful → https://www.contentful.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nFirebase → https://firebase.google.com/\nCallstack → https://www.callstack.com/\nMercari → https://about.mercari.com/en/\nvpTech/ → https://careers.veepee.com/en/vptech-2/\nNativeBase → https://nativebase.io/\nStream → https://getstream.io/\nSiteGround → https://www.siteground.com/\nYoast → https://yoast.com/\nNovermber Five → https://www.novemberfive.co/\nTwilio → https://www.twilio.com/ahoy\nBCGDV → https://bcgdv.com/\nFullscript → https://fullscript.com/\nUtopia Music → https://utopiamusic.com/\nSISU → https://www.sisu.tools/",

The promise of easily sharing code, better enforcing organizational standards, greater developer mobility due to common tooling, and more is very appealing. Still, if approached naively, a monorepo will quickly turn into a huge mess: skyrocketing slow CI times, spaghetti dependencies among projects, hard to navigate, and ultimately leading to frustration. In this talk, we will look at the available tooling, how to kickstart a new React monorepo in particular, and we will learn the key ingredients required to build a successful, long-running monorepo that scales.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\nAg Grid → https://www.ag-grid.com/\nToptal → https://www.toptal.com/freelance-jobs\nRangle.io → https://rangle.io/ \nWPEngine → https://wpengine.com/\nVodafone → https://careers.vodafone.com/ \n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nBitvavo → https://bitvavo.com/\nIonic → https://ionic.io/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\nKontent by Kentico → https://kontent.ai/\nDecentology → https://www.decentology.com/\nXata → https://xata.io/\nDocker → https://www.docker.com/\nShopify → https://www.shopify.com/careers\nWix Engineering → https://wix.com\nNearForm → https://www.nearform.com/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nSanity → https://www.sanity.io/\nSnyk → https://snyk.io/\nContentful → https://www.contentful.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nFirebase → https://firebase.google.com/\nCallstack → https://www.callstack.com/\nMercari → https://about.mercari.com/en/\nvpTech/ → https://careers.veepee.com/en/vptech-2/\nNativeBase → https://nativebase.io/\nStream → https://getstream.io/\nSiteGround → https://www.siteground.com/\nYoast → https://yoast.com/\nNovermber Five → https://www.novemberfive.co/\nTwilio → https://www.twilio.com/ahoy\nBCGDV → https://bcgdv.com/\nFullscript → https://fullscript.com/\nUtopia Music → https://utopiamusic.com/\nSISU → https://www.sisu.tools/",

This presentation will demonstrate how quickly a developer can get up and running with headless WordPress development using the Remix full stack framework. Using open source tools like WPGraphQL and Atlas Content Modeler, you can transform your WordPress site into a powerful headless CMS that serves data via GraphQL. We’ll see how we can query for and use that data in a Remix app, and also discuss how the framework’s focus on web fundamentals can benefit both the developer and the visitors who use our sites.\n\nThis event would not take place without the support of sponsors:\n\n🏆 Platinum Sponsors\nAg Grid → https://www.ag-grid.com/\nToptal → https://www.toptal.com/freelance-jobs\nRangle.io → https://rangle.io/ \nWPEngine → https://wpengine.com/\nVodafone → https://careers.vodafone.com/ \n\n🥇 Gold Sponsors\nStackHawk → https://www.stackhawk.com/\nBitvavo → https://bitvavo.com/\nIonic → https://ionic.io/\nJetBrains → https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\nKontent by Kentico → https://kontent.ai/\nDecentology → https://www.decentology.com/\nXata → https://xata.io/\nDocker → https://www.docker.com/\nShopify → https://www.shopify.com/careers\nWix Engineering → https://wix.com\nNearForm → https://www.nearform.com/\nFocus Reactive → https://focusreactive.com/\nSanity → https://www.sanity.io/\nSnyk → https://snyk.io/\nContentful → https://www.contentful.com/\nNx → https://nx.dev/\n\n🥈 Silver Sponsors\nFirebase → https://firebase.google.com/\nCallstack → https://www.callstack.com/\nMercari → https://about.mercari.com/en/\nvpTech/ → https://careers.veepee.com/en/vptech-2/\nNativeBase → https://nativebase.io/\nStream → https://getstream.io/\nSiteGround → https://www.siteground.com/\nYoast → https://yoast.com/\nNovermber Five → https://www.novemberfive.co/\nTwilio → https://www.twilio.com/ahoy\nBCGDV → https://bcgdv.com/\nFullscript → https://fullscript.com/\nUtopia Music → https://utopiamusic.com/\nSISU → https://www.sisu.tools/",

This was a pain point for our team while rebooting our design system. We discovered that although our system was built with inclusivity in mind, our documentation setup was equal parts brittle and complex —  especially when working with our React-based component library. Multiple repos, rigid layout restrictions, and an impressive amount of gymnastics were needed to render React component examples. \n\nDocumentation became a maintenance nightmare for the core team — and a barrier to entry for external contributors. Our team was in danger of having stale documentation while our system’s features were still being built. In this talk, you’ll learn how we streamlined our component library documentation tooling with Gatsby and MDX. Pair this with inclusive best practices, and your component library documentation will be silky smooth.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with a documentation system that’s tough to maintain, this session is for you.\n\nSlides - https://noti.st/resource11/2uy6Ol/smoothly-inclusive-component-library-documentation",

CDK is a next-level abstraction in infrastructure as code, allowing developers who were traditionally unfamiliar with cloud computing to build scalable APIs and web services using their existing skillset, and do so in only a few lines of code. In this talk, you’ll learn how to use the TypeScript flavor of CDK to build a hyper-scalable real-time API with GraphQL, Lambda, DynamoDB, and AWS AppSync . At the end of the talk, I’ll live code an API from scratch in just a couple of minutes and then test out queries, mutations, and subscriptions. By the end of the talk, you should have a good understanding of GraphQL, AppSync, and CDK and be ready to build an API in your next project using TypeScript and CDK.",

Some are introduced by us, others by other teams or systems. Some are painfully obvious and affect all users, others only occur in edge (cases). And the ways of finding, and eventually, preventing them, are just as diverse: be it snapshot, unit, integration, end to end tests or automated visual tests, every kind comes with its challenges and opportunities. Testing UIs is hard, but in the end, only test automation can give us the confidence we need to move fast and refactor our code relentlessly. In this talk we are going to look at what kinds of bugs there are, which tests are most effective for catching which, and how we can implement them using modern front end technologies.\n\nSlides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HIdY3-DfRNB4Mjp6sEvlp7Pt_nKFvx5F5Qlgnf6mq4I/edit?usp=sharing",

And when it comes to SVG, the Path element is the building block of building blocks. During this presentation, we’ll take a deep dive into the language of the SVG path. Not only will we learn to read path data, but we'll also gain the ability to manipulate paths on the fly with the help of React - no Adobe Illustrator or help from a time-strapped designer necessary!\n\nhttps://slides.com/monicawojciechowska/svg-path",

Congrats! I am sure it is awesome but did you put the same effort into its documentation? Component libraries tend to have giant APIs, dozens of components, hundreds of props and thousands of permutations. That is a lot of information to unpack.\n\nWe could make the documentation very long or... super interactive. We combined component previews, API documentation, props editing and code editing into a single seamless experience. You can quickly explore various settings of each component while watching the code write itself.\n\nThis talk will show you how to leverage common tools and concepts such as Prettier, babel and AST transformations to build the documentation that can literally work for you.\n\nSlides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eniROQoSzMWax1sliB9s_TMgKwn84xXfSXow1sJXesM/edit?usp=sharing",

We'll then look into tooling, and talk about how you can introduce accessibility testing into your teams and existing code.

Its author is the Japan noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu. Till then countless of writers put their thoughts on paper and countless of readers experience their stories. People write for decades and we, as software developers, kind of ignore their craft. We write too. Not novels but software. Isn't it this still writing? Believe it or not there is a lot in common between creating fiction and writing code. In this presentation we will see how close we are to giants like Hemingway and Stephen King. Can we get some of their wisdom and apply it to our daily job as engineers. Come to this talk and will get a few practical advices. I hope my presentation will make you a slightly better React developer.\n\nSlides - https://we-are-all-hemingway.vercel.app/#/",

TypeScript proponents proclaim that it eliminates entire classes of bugs that affect our applications. But what exactly are those bugs? Which ones are particular to building React components and applications? Is TypeScript worth the learning curve?\n\nIn this session geared towards devs with prior experience building React applications, let’s answer those questions. We’ll walk through the common bugs that infect our apps and learn how the use of strong types with TypeScript can help prevent them.

However, few take into consideration the impacts these will have on performance of the application. In this talk you’ll find out how some commonly used patterns have an adverse effect on the speed of your app, and how to avoid using them. The talk explorse UI and state management but also dives into some native-specific issues and look at how to prevent them.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

When done successfully, it suddenly becomes trivial to translate standard designs into code. In fact, we may even find that this translation step starts to feel somewhat redundant. In a world of components, how should our design processes change? How should our tooling change? How should we, as React developers, better enable this change? In this talk, you'll see the current state of design and development, and where we could go—if we're willing to push for it.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

This is great because one tech team can build both your web app and native mobile experience. The problem is developers hate writing things twice. There have been a couple of efforts to build a unifying technology to write an application once and have it work on both web and native. Yet this is not always the best approach. There is value in only sharing your business and state logic; keeping your render code separate.\n\nIn this talk, Ben Elerby gives real examples from his work with MADE.COM, migrating their web and mobile application to React and React-Native with code sharing as a primary objective.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

But what language should it be?

Then you started getting some users and suddenly you needed multiple instances of your Monolith Backend and more replicas of your Database. Your user base kept growing and also your development team was growing, so you split your Monolith backend into Microservices with their own Databases.\n\nYou’re very happy about the situation until you realize that the same problem you had on the backend it’s now on the frontend. Multiple teams are working on the same codebase, it’s hard to do frequent releases and there’re a lot of cross-team communications that slow things down.\n\nDAZN battle-tested the Microfrontends architecture leveraging feature like blue-green deployments in the frontend, framework agnostic teams and drastically reduced cross-team dependencies.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

React is built primarily for the browser, while Node has fundamentally different operational constraints to the browser. While working as a Principal Architect and Consultant, it has become painfully clear to David that React’s Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a performance bottleneck for web backends around the world.

In principle, you can paint almost anything you can dream of. In practice, WebGL is hard, and though projects like three.js make it easier, there are still a lot of hurdles to integrating it into your site in a practical way.\n\nLet's explore how Hooks can make it easier to integrate powerful GPU-driven visuals into our React apps, giving us the best of both worlds: the power of WebGL with the ease and expressiveness of a React component tree.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Adam's team could have pursued a typical release strategy—instead, they got creative with React Native.\n\nThey built a strangler-style architecture, a technique commonly reserved for web services, to release our greenfield React Native product user-by-user. The effect was some pretty unique and awesome advantages to how we built and tested our new app—but software is never perfect.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

By splitting our app into small, digestible parts the system as a whole becomes a lot easier to understand.\nCSS was made in an era where documents were the height of the web. It doesn't fit easily into component-based systems, making styling one of the pain points of building React applications.\nWhat if we took the best of JavaScript and the best of CSS, and combined them together to create the ultimate solution? Glen Maddern (CSS Modules co-creator) and I sat down and starting thinking about styling in this new paradigm.

It not only allows us to use technologies we know already, like React, to provide first-class native experience to our users, but also to support many platforms, like Android and iOS at once, from within the same codebase.\nThis talk will explore various patterns that turned to be useful over the course of few projects I did. It will also demonstrate techniques that can be used to write truly universal apps, ie. ones that share core across web, native and more.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

As if it is an elevated way of thinking, only accessible to the chosen few. Nothing is less true! It is the most natural way to look at programming problems. You just might not realize it yet! In this talk, Michel will demonstrate that many complex UI problems, such as form validation and routing, can all be seen as '*actions* that change *facts* which leads to *reactions*'. And as soon as we start distinguishing those concepts in our applications; our code will become more declarative, more concise and less imperative.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In this talk, Forbes will help you through that initial stage by identifying some of the problems you're likely to experience and giving you the tools to work through them. We'll cover adding types to code that initially looks too dynamic to type, adding runtime type checking (and whether that's a good idea) and finally, how you publish your type checked modules to npm.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

With a wrong workflow linting can be really a pain and will slow you and your team down. With a proper setup though, it can save you hours of manual work reformatting the code and reducing the code-review overhead.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You quickly add some hello world text and maybe even a Pokemon image. Things are really starting to look up… \nAnd then you need to add another view and you realize that you need to navigate somewhere. So you check out the React Native Docs and are quickly greeted by IOSTabBar, Navigation, and NavigationExperimental modules. With so many different options in the core codebase you realize that it’s still a bit of an unsolved problem. Now you’re looking at 3rd party integrations… and you start to wonder, just how should you implement navigation? \nThis talk will outline the different approaches to navigation available in React Native and in the RN eco-system, and the pro’s and con’s of each solution.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Apparently handling touch and gestures is quite tricky as it often needs to interact with the application code which runs asynchronously in the javascript VM. This talk is going to be about how the gesture system has been designed and implemented in React Native and how to use it to stay out of trouble.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

His first professional developer job was to program insurance rate calculations in Microsoft Excel, the paragon of Reactive Programming which must be why he now works on React. In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.\nhttps://github.com/gnoff\nhttps://twitter.com/joshcstory\n\nSathya Gunasekaran | Meta\nSathya hated the Dragon Book in school but somehow ended up working on compilers all his career.

    "description": "RedwoodJS, the full-stack, open source, React web application framework, has adopted React Server Components in a major architectural shift. By combining the strengths of SSR, streaming, Suspense, RSCs, and Server Actions, we have created a new version of Redwood that is both simpler and more capable. In this talk I will share the lessons we learned in implementing RSCs on top of Vite, and dig into how Redwood’s approach to RSCs differs from Next.js. Come see how we make data fetching (both client- and server-side) trivial with our unique Cell pattern, how to execute server functions from the client, and how our routes file makes complex URLs easy to manage. I will also reveal our roadmap and future innovations you can expect from the framework!\n\nAmy Dutton | RedwoodJS\nAmy loves using her 22 years of internet experience to teach developers how to design, and designers how to develop.

    "description": "You know that annoying bug? The one that doesn’t show up locally, but people keep reporting over and over? And no matter how many times you try to recreate the environment you can’t reproduce it? You’ve gone through the breadcrumbs, read through the stack trace, and are now playing detective to piece together support tickets to make sure it’s real. Join Sentry developer Ryan Albrecht in this talk to learn how developers can use Session Replay - a tool that provides video-like reproductions of user interactions to identify directly from your users, problems and reproduce & fix faster (without rolling your head on your keyboard).\n\nRyan Albrecht | Sentry\nRyan can always be found experimenting with new ways to break (and then fix) websites and frontend codebases. Prior to joining Sentry to build out emerging developer tools such as Session Replay, Ryan spent time at Pinterest growth hacking, and building internal tools, as well as at Meta making commenting on facebook.com easier and faster.\nhttps://github.com/ryan953\n\n\nThis talk was given at React Conf 2024, co-hosted by Meta (https://www.meta.com) and Callstack (https://www.callstack.com/).

In this talk, I aim to provide a practical guide to web accessibility in React apps, completed with many interactive examples.\n\nWe’ll start with brief introduction to web accessibility as a whole, we will explore the way assistive technology interacts with web pages, how accessibility tree is constructed and used to navigate web content. Then, we’ll go over a few common patterns in React apps and how to implement without compromising accessibility.

But, in the last several years, React and its ilk have proven that sophisticated approaches to immutability and asynchrony allow for unprecedented scale and complexity in the front-end. Now, the tables have turned, and back-end frameworks are starting to wake up to the benefits of asynchronous processes and event sourcing patterns, following the trail that React has blazed.",

When we first saw React’s abstractions in 2012, we were horrified. We eventually were convinced. Now, the roles have reversed. Gatsby, Next and Remix all showed the need for React on the server. It took a bit, but the React team caught on. For the last decade, the community has adopted React’s innovative patterns. This time is different. The innovation of Server Components didn’t come from React. It came from us. In this talk, I’ll be discussing our responsibilities as the new shepherds of React, the React community itself.\n\nAbout Theo\nTheo is a strange mix of full stack dev, youtuber, shitposter and CEO. After helping Twitch migrate to React and TypeScript, he started ping.gg.

They bundle a frontend with an API, and offer a ridiculously fast, 'lego block' integration experience. But what makes a good component? There is no REST convention to follow, and publishers have landed on dramatically fragmented solutions to challenges like styling, routing, and composability. In this talk, we'll explore the rise of components as the ideal developer tool, and unpack the tradeoffs among these fragmented approaches.\n\nAbout Colin\nColin is co-founder of Clerk, where he helps build authentication and user management tools for React. He has 15 years of frontend experience and is obsessed with making frontend developers more autonomous.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023. Learn more at https://reactathon.com",

    "description": "Splitting the Work: Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense\nMany React developers use server rendering to improve performance. Before React 18, however, all four (4) steps in the server rendering process (data fetching, rendering to HTML, loading JavaScript, and hydrating) had to be completed for the entire app at once. This meant that a bigger or more complex part of your app would block other parts from moving onto the next step, making your app appear slower. Thanks to optimizations in React 18, you can use Suspense to break your app into smaller parts that go through these steps independently. Users benefit from an app that they can see sooner and interact with almost instantaneously!\n\nAbout Shaundai\nShaundai is a Senior Software Engineer (Netflix) and TC39 Delegate based in Atlanta, GA, US.

    "description": "The Costs & Benefits of React Server Components\nReact server components (RSC) were initially announced in 2020 and finally made broadly available as a beta via next.js a few months ago. There has been talk and hype around them for years, but genuine understanding of what they are, how they work, and where they shine vs struggle is in short supply. In this talk from the former engineering manager of the next.js team, we'll go into depth on RSC from a balanced perspective, and together we will build a solid understanding of when RSC is the right tool to solve the problems you're facing, and when to look elsewhere. We'll also work through practical examples of RSC in action, and take steps towards shifting your perspective into understanding the new architecture model that RSC sits on top of.\n\nAbout Jeff\nJeff has builds web-tooling-oriented software and manages engineering teams doing the same sort of things. Most recently, he was the manager for the next.js team and for part of the react core team at Vercel, and before that led web development at HashiCorp.

Have you used a hot new stack that everyone loves but still don’t know how to make it performant? Well, it’s because we think about performance as a after-thought after it becomes a bottleneck and when our infra gets costly, ouch! But there is a way to solve this, introducing Core React. We won’t be introducing new tools but going back to how we need to tell React what the DOM should look like. In this talk, we will finally understand why useCallback and useMemo are used, why Lighthouse doesn’t represent performance, how we can minimize component re-render, why it re-renders? and lastly how to profile it with React devtools.\n\nAbout Ankita\nAnkita is an Educator and teaches courses online or sells digital products, such as her Next.js course or her course program on transforming devs into engineering leads.

    "description": "The long-tail of type safety\nSo you've added TypeScript to your codebase, tweaked your tsconfig file and you're flying high with the confidence of no more runtime exceptions and the joy of being able to confidently refactor your code, right? I've been there, it's a great feeling. But as you soon discover, adding TS to your code is only the first step of true end-to-end type safety. In fact, it's likely the easiest step. What about API calls, databases, parsed JSON, query string parameters, request and response bodies, session storage and all those third party libraries and SDKs? These are the I/O boundaries of your application and they can destroy your otherwise flawless type safety. In this talk I'll walk you through the long tail of type safety, approaches to implementing type-safety in the overlooked areas of your stack, and tools to help you do so. You'll come away from this talk well equipped to make your codebase more robust and resilient to runtime exceptions. And best of all you'll get that sweet TypeScript confidence back again!\n\nAbout Simon\nSimon is a YC Founder, software engineer, speaker and educator.

The impressive capabilities are usurped only by the speed at which they are evolving and improving. So what does this mean for frontend development -- or for engineering itself? These are fascinating questions to explore -- with a potential for a paradigmatic shift the likes of which we haven't seen since the Industrial Revolution or the dawn of the World Wide Web. Join us as we discuss these ideas and more with Sean Grove & Swyx -- who will help us to contextualize these changes with insight and even some demonstrations of the technologies & concepts discussed.\n\nAbout Sean Grove\nSean Grove is a seasoned tech leader and software engineer who's passionate about innovation and making complex problems simple.

    "description": "At Docker, we are using GraphQL alongside our existing REST APIs and making it work without a GraphQL server. Instead, we use GraphQL client side, where it serves as the interface to our network layer and the glue that binds our components together. We have taken this approach as a progressive solution to the difficult problem of introducing GraphQL to an existing application stack. By breaking the rules a bit we gain many of the benefits that GraphQL provides immediately while spreading out the implementation over many releases. While a novel approach I also envision a future where running GraphQL on the client is not uncommon. With the advent of blockchain technology and the concept of “dapps” we must reconsider the role of the application that runs on the end user’s device. By running GraphQL on the client we can consume remote GraphQL services, interact directly with the blockchain, browser / native APIs, and more through GraphQL.\n\nTyler is an engineer at Docker working on UI applications. When not writing code you can find him at a beach near his home in San Francisco.",

When we see people modernize their app architecture and move to React, they often want to migrate their API to GraphQL as part of the same effort. But while React is super easy to adopt in a small part of your app at a time, GraphQL can seem like a much larger investment. In this talk, we’ll go over the fastest and most effective ways for React developers to incrementally migrate their existing APIs and backends to GraphQL, then talk about opportunities for improvement in the space. If you’re using React and are interested in GraphQL, but are looking for an extra push to get it up and running at your company, this is the talk for you!\n\nSashko has been working on open source developer tools for the last 5 years.

And let’s be honest, putting everything in useEffect hooks doesn’t help much. Thankfully, there is a science (well, math) to side effects, formalized in state machines and statecharts, that can help us visually model and understand how to declaratively orchestrate effects, no matter how complex they get. In this talk, we’ll ditch the useEffect hook and discover how these computer science principles can be used to simplify effects in our React apps.\n\nAboud David Khourshid\nDavid is a software engineer who loves playing piano and is passionate about animations, state machines, cutting-edge user interfaces, and open-source.

But it's not just the UX that suffers, the developer experience of fetching in components creates a lot of incidental complexity too: data fetching, data mutations, busy spinners, optimistic UI, error handling, form state, network race conditions, user event interruptions, and all the code that holds it together gets pretty difficult! As we've built Remix, we've gotten a lot of practice leaning on React Router's nested route abstraction to solve all of these problems all at once. Now, millions of React Router apps in production can get the same benefits because we've moved the responsibility of knowing When To Fetch into React Router itself!\n\nAbout Ryan Florence\nRyan is the co-founder of Remix, co-creator of React Router, and co-founder of React Training.\n\nEvent production and post-production by EventLoop.

For 20 years, he has been involved in software development and continues strong today. He is recognized as a Google Developer Expert in Web and Machine Learning, but informally he is an “open sourcerer” and aspires to one day become a mad scientist.

    "description": "As the Frontend Platform team at Eventbrite switched from Backbone/Marionette over to React, it had to convince other developers, managers, directors, and non-engineers that React was the right path. And the rationale for moving wasn’t just because React is insanely popular. There are many tangible benefits that make the effort of migrating worthwhile. New to React and want to learn a little about how it works? Seeking ammunition to convince your team to make the change? Come learn about why we made the decision to transition to React, through an introduction of how to build user interactions with React.\n\nBen is a Christian, a husband and a father of 2 with 10+ years of experience developing user interfaces for the Web. He currently leads and manages Eventbrite’s Frontend Platform team. On the side, Ben also enjoys playing basketball, DIY, watching movies, and blogging.

That along with hot reloading code and the ability to push over the air updates to published apps make React Native a tempting proposition. This sounds too good to be true so what’s the catch? React Native is a framework for building native apps using Javascript. Many native developers rightly associate hybrid Javascript apps with disappointing consumer experiences and frustrating development environments. Over the years the same promises have been made by many other Javascript based frameworks, so why is React Native any different? This talk will be from the perspective of an experienced iOS developer who has been working with React Native for the last 2 years and has shipped several cross platform apps with it.\n\nHarry is an iOS developer who is very enthusiastic about React Native. Currently he works as a mobile contractor with various companies. In the past he’s worked as a Software Engineer at Facebook, Apple and a number of startups you've probably never heard of.",

    "description": "Ben Holmes - React Rally 2023\n\nPicking up a new technology, developers stick with defaults. It's a fact that every tool from JQuery to NextJS has needed to face. At their worst, defaults ship hundreds of wasted JS kilobytes for routing, state, and other baggage developers may never use. But at their best, defaults give us a simple baseline to start from, with a clear path to add the exact set of features our project demands. This is the magic of opt-in design.\n\nLet's see how smart defaults guide modern frontend tools from Astro to React Server Components, and why this new era reshapes your workflow, and website performance metrics, for the better.",

    "description": "Matheus Albuquerque - React Rally 2023\n\nLibraries like Tailwind became quite popular and their utility-first—aka atomic classes—approach was an interesting paradigm shift in CSS. Many developers love it, and it's understandable why.\n\nHowever, we tend to forget that the core of this technique isn't new. Way before Bootstrap we all had our own small CSS snippets copied from project to project with similar classes.\n\nHowever, there are good reasons why we stopped doing that for a while and we should discuss them before using them everywhere.\n\nIn this session, we'll discuss the evolution of scalable CSS, walk through the limitations and drawbacks of Atomic CSS, and also figure out where this concept can come in handy.",

Excelling at any of these \"soft\" skills could mean taking courses to learn more about the tools, asking a mentor to guide you when you feel overwhelmed, and engaging in a ton of trial and error when it matters the most.\n\nSoft skills are competencies. We must consistently and actively work at developing these abilities so we can be successful teammates, managers, leaders and coworkers.

We won’t be introducing new tools but going back to how we need to tell React what the DOM should look like.

We’re already starting to see how more tools, and more education, lead to more innovation and a future where open, cheap LLMs will be available to everyone.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll walk through the process of harnessing an LLM’s imagination and empowering it with knowledge and tools from the real world to perform one of the most delicate human tasks: creating mixtapes.\n\nWe’ll discover the subtle nuances of Prompt Engineering, learn how to manage and manipulate a chatbot’s memory, dig into the complexities of ChatGPT's response time and Vercel's Edge Functions with Next.js, and discuss some open source tools that we can leverage with existing and future LLMs as we explore this new frontier.",

This mainly comes from our Front-End components being highly coupled either through poorly written CSS or components having too many responsibilities.\n\nBut there is a way we can avoid these such code bases.\n\nWe will learn in this talk how building your Front-End Architecture with intention will keep code bases manageable and easy to reason about, allowing for rapid development and easily responding to changing requirements. And we will also learn how this also leads to code bases that’s easier for new people to onboard and contribute to, allowing them to learn the code base at their own pace.\n\nThis is done by leveraging Component-Driven Design and Brad’s Frost’s Atomic Design to promote component isolation. With the attributes these architectural decisions promote, we can leverage techniques such as Functional CSS to further promote component isolation by inverting the flow of control of our CSS. These and other tools and techniques will allow us to build a code base of loosely coupled components, where Engineers only need to understand the component they are working in to start providing value.\n\nBy the end of this talk, those in attendance will have the tools they’ll need to build or migrate their code bases to something more loosely coupled, decreasing Engineering time for tasks, promoting rapid iteration and simply making a Front-End code base much more of a joy to work in.",

    "description": "At the end of 2021, we successfully rolled out the New React Native Architecture in the Facebook app. Now, it’s time to empower every React Native developer on the globe to use the New React Native Architecture, both the new Fabric renderer and the new TurboModule system. But migrating an entire ecosystem to a New Architecture is no easy task. To support the whole community in this endeavor, we lined up a set of tools and materials that will help both app and library developers to join us in this journey. In the talk, we will present how the New React Native Architecture looks in the OSS space. We will discuss the impact this will have on developing React Native projects. Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nNicola Corti is a Google Developer Expert for Kotlin. He has been working with the language since before version 1.0, and he is the maintainer of several open-source libraries and tools for mobile developers. He's currently working in the React Native Core team at Meta, building one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Furthermore, he is an active member of the developer community. His involvement goes from speaking at international conferences to being a member of CFP committees and supporting developer communities across Europe. In his free time, he also loves baking, podcasting, and running.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

    "description": "React Native has been used across Microsoft a lot, over the last few years. Only recently, though, we have realized how its developer experience and its community are in a precarious situation. We decided, then, to approach the problem in the most impactful way possible: by going straight to the source! Join us in this talk to hear what we are doing to make life better for everyone in the community, from open sourcing new tools, to creating new cross-company groups and even in collaborating directly with Meta in the core codebase (and not just there!). As a smart person once said: “a rising tide lifts all boats” - and we, we want to be the moon!\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nAdam is a principal software engineer at Microsoft. He spent his first 20 years building C++ apps and products, and in 2018, he made the leap to JavaScript and React Native and hasn't looked back. Adam is a developer experience enthusiast, a tool builder, and a creative storyteller. When Adam's not working, he's adventuring with his family, making something out of wood or Lego, working on his house, or tinkering with some new piece of tech.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

    "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/foEacW-Ze3w/sddefault.jpg",
    "description": "The JavaScript Interface (JSI) allows us to access native APIs directly from the JS context. Unlike traditional JSON bridge-based native modules, API access is synchronous and even non-serialisable data types can be expressed. However, JSI is largely undocumented, so it may be unclear how to use it. In this talk, we'll learn how to write JSI code to bridge any individual API from the Objective-C runtime to JS and demonstrate how we could even bridge *all* the APIs the Objective-C runtime offers, by walking through the approach used in the shirakaba/react-native-native-runtime GitHub repository.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nA cross-platform hobbyist and ex-Smart TV app developer, Jamie enjoys putting JavaScript in places it doesn't belong, usually with a view to building apps for foreign language study.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

    "description": "What do you do when you need to work with some really bad code? It seems like a no-win situation: whether you rewrite it, do a \"\"refactoring sprint,\"\" or just live with it, you have to pay a big cost. But these aren't the only options. There's a way to get control of your code so that you can make whatever improvements you need in a low-stress, low-cost way. To explain how, this talk is split into two parts. In the first part we'll look at a messy React Native component and see how effortless it is to make improvements to the code if you have comprehensive tests. In the second part we'll tackle that big \"\"if:\"\" how in the world can you get comprehensive tests like that? By the end of this talk you'll have the information to decide if this approach to testing and refactoring will help your project, and if so, you'll have next steps to hone your skills in this approach.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nJosh Justice has worked as a developer for 17 years across mobile, frontend, and backend platforms.

It is the principle behind every map viewer (google maps, apple plans, leaflet etc.). Our use case was to give our users the ability to view and add markers on building floor plans, with sufficient precision (hence a good zooming ability) and with good performance (network and interactions) in order to be usable on site. From a proof of concept using react-native-maps, we moved to a home made production component built with reanimated 2, fully written in javascript under 500 lines of code.

    "description": "Stripe React Native: A simple set of solutions to a complex set of problems Collecting payments in an app is notoriously difficult. Before you get started, you need to decide whether you can collect payments directly, or if you need go through in app purchases. Then the wide world of different payment methods, security, PCI compliance, optimized checkout flows, and more awaits you. That isn’t a task list that gets many developers excited With Stripe’s React Native libraries, our goal is to provide a broad set of solutions for any payment scenario an app might have. This doesn’t just mean exposing a method to charge card details though. Today we’ll go through some of the features offered by Stripe React Native, when/why you’d use them, and then go through a quick demo. 1. Payment Elements like CardField, AuBECS Form, and Bank redirects, which you can use to create payment methods for customers, no matter where they are or what payment methods they use 2. Don’t feel like spending weeks of engineering time on a Checkout flow in your app? Stripe provides the PaymentSheet which can now be customized and tailored to your app’s own UI. With PaymentSheet, your checkout flow is already optimized, and you can start accepting new payment methods without even shipping out an app update (that’s right, server-side controls!) 3. We’ve mentioned payment methods a lot. Something that’s easily forgotten, especially by me living in a country where credit cards are so ubiquitous, is that if your business plans on operating on an international or global scale, you need to support the payment methods that your customers are comfortable and familiar with. Luckily, whether you’re using PaymentSheet or your own checkout flow, Stripe React Native supports over 20 payment methods. 4. What would a mobile payment talk even be if I didn’t mention Apple Pay and Google Pay? Of course Stripe React native supports the full suite of APIs from each, which means you’re not giving up anything by working in React Native. In addition to that, you even have access to the more specific use cases like adding cards to a users native mobile wallet! demo of the Payment Sheet with customized appearance - when to use the payment sheet demo of custom UI using CardField - when to use the individual elements and build your own checkout flow demo of adding a card to your native wallet ? - this might be too specific of a use case Last slide on Stripe’s future plans for React Native- releasing first-class support for it with new mobile features: insert new libraries that are currently unreleased but will be available before the talk itself\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nCharlie is a software engineer at Stripe, where he works on ensuring developers using Stripe have powerful tools at their disposal to get their work done efficiently, and enjoyably! One of his focuses is the Stripe React Native SDK, which allows you to build delightful payment experiences faster and easier than ever.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

    "description": "While code goes through a build/release workflow, and your app handles user data, there is a middle ground of \"\"Content Management\"\". Servers can provide content and configuration to continuously tweak the behavior of your app in the wild. How can we make this process easier and more robust? What happens if we blur the lines between your app's user data, content, and code? With React Native's primitives, can we re-attach the front end of the \"\"Headless CMS\"\", and directly render our content on every platform?\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nEric is self-taught software engineer who has used React since the year it was released.

From the upcoming React Native new architecture, there will be more platform-independent shared implementations and more abstraction layers.

Previously, Ram had written and spoken about adding instrumentation to understand the performance characteristics of the app.\nAs the next step, he will explore the various optimizations that can be done in this talk. He will focus on the Javascript section, something where there are many more low hanging fruits to optimizie.\nStarting from React Dev Tools, he will look at how developers can leverage their existing knowledge of web performance to attack mobile perf. He will talk about understanding SysTrace and Sampling Profilers. He will also debunk common myths like the problems with measuring app performance using Chrome JS profiler, debug versions of the app, etc. \nIn this talk, he will plan to outline a holistic approach that can be used to dive deeper into React Native performance.",

    "description": "Abstract:\nIn the past 5 years, the Wix mobile app has gone through quite a bit - a brand new look was launched, a large number of features were added in a short period of time, and the number of our users tripled. Unfortunately, one implication of product growth, is a slower performance, especially when it came to things like seamless transition, fluent animations and general slickness of the app. \n\nOver the past year, we made a tremendous effort to improve these regressions. Our ongoing efforts have so far resulted in almost 60% cumulative improvement in all performance metrics.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll deep into all of our secret ingredients for better performance in React Native applications, together with practical examples of:\n-Improving startup time\n-Responsive gestures \n-Preload prioritization\nFurthermore, I’ll outline some general work we’ve done that led us to these improvements, like the right way to measure and analyse your app performance on production, and how you can implement these tips and tricks.",

Soon after it went public, React Native Testing Library was created trying to implement their style of testing for React Native components. And a few months later another one came to light out of the blue, quickly becoming an official one. The community ended up with two almost identical libraries. Sounds confusing, huh? It was! This story is about all this drama, how it eventually turned out, how community and empathy wins, how businesses help sustain OSS, sprinkled with examples of how you can test your React Native components with just JavaScript.",

Controlled rollout using feature flags is a way to deliver features to your users safely, but doing it on mobile comes with some challenges. How do you propagate feature flagging configuration to mobile devices that don’t always have a strong network? As a mobile developer, you want to be able to use the latest flag configuration, but you also don’t want to stop someone using the app just because you can’t load the feature flag config. \n\nIn this talk, we'll start with why controlled rollout is important and how feature flags enable you to do it successfully, then we will talk about mobile specifics, and then a demo with React Native.",

All these projects were inspired by needs of navigation libraries and were meant to fill the gap between platform native navigation solutions and ones that are available in React Native.\nOur React Native projects often starts by deciding whether to go with native navigation (react-native-navigation) or JS navigation library (react-navigation). But given all these improvements can we still call react-navigation \"not native\"? In this talk we will learn how Gesture Handler and Reanimated libraries came to live with navigation being the driving force. In this context I will discuss how far is react-navigation from finally proclaiming the badge of really native navigation library.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/kmagiera/it-all-starts-with-navigation",

    "description": "How do you manage user data in your React Native app? A popular approach is to use Redux or MobX with a persistence adapter. This works great for small, simple apps, but it has a serious flaw: it doesn't scale very well. Introducing WatermelonDB — a next generation database for React and React Native. Here's why you should care: \n- Highly scalable. Works as well for 20,000 database records as it does for 100. Instant launch. No matter how much data you have, the app still launches with near-zero performance penalty \n- Lazy loaded everything. Don't load all data at launch, query only the exact records you need. That's why it's fast! \n- Fully reactive. All records and queries are observable using RxJS. A change in one place propagates to all other places automatically \n- Made for React. Comes with a HOC so you can declaratively tie together data and components \n- Relational. Document stores are simple, but relational databases are powerful. Want to find, say, all posts that have a comment by user X? Sure, that'll be about a millisecond. \n- Cross-platform. Works on iOS and Android (using SQLite), on the web (using LokiJS), and it's easy to add more \n- Performant. Uses asynchronous processing, multi-threading (also on the web), resource sharing, and caching to squeeze extra performance \n- Built for sync. Comes with syncing primitives so you can supply your own synchronization code",

We’ve decided it is time for Expo to be redesigned and split into multiple, separate native + JS (+ more 🤭) libraries which developers will be able to opt-out of using in Expo standalone apps and also to use in their plain RN projects. This talk will describe the process of making this transition, design of the solution we’ve settled on and difficulties we had to overcome along the way (and how we’ve done it).",

Little did we know how an innocuous release could have triggered a domino effect resulting in failing builds for nearly every React Native developer out there. With the wisdom of hindsight, we’ll walk through what happened, what are our lessons learned and the lowlights of this incident. We’ll have the opportunity to look through the internals of React Native, discover our incident-response culture, and learn how we’re hardening our ecosystem to protect us against similar events in the future. Join me as we revive this incident, and don’t miss this opportunity to gain insights, be inspired, and embrace the lessons learned from the day I broke React Native.\n\n🗣 Speaker Bio\n\nNicola Corti is a Google Developer Expert for Kotlin. He has been working with the language since before version 1.0, and he is the maintainer of several open-source libraries and tools for mobile developers. He's currently working in the React Native Core team at Meta, building one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Furthermore, he is an active member of the developer community. His involvement goes from speaking at international conferences to being a member of CFP committees and supporting developer communities across Europe.

    "description": "📖 About the talk \n\nExpensify's mission is to \"Live Rich, Have Fun, Save the World\", and at a high level that means building a community of people who come together to solve humanity’s urgent challenges. This guiding principle has informed the decision to rebuild Expensify's product as a next-gen collaboration tool, from the ground up with a fully open-source front-end. This approach gives us access to specialized talent, enables us to scale up our engineering capacity without expanding the internal team, and ultimately preserves Expensify's tight-knit culture, keeping us laser-focused on our long-term vision. In this speech, we'll take a tour of Expensify's open-source contribution program and demonstrate how the company engages a global network of contributors to build features, fix bugs, and ultimately build a better product. Our commitment to communal ownership of our dependencies, and the drive to build up the entire React Native community, ties into our long-term goal to build a community that empowers people to \"Get Shit Done.\" We'll discuss in detail how the program works, including the various roles we’ve made available for external contributors, how they can get paid to contribute, and some lessons learned along the way. Join us as we explore how Expensify is building bridges with open-source and React Native, and how this approach aligns with our mission to make a positive impact on the world.\n\n🗣 Speaker Bio\nRory Abraham is a Full Stack developer at Expensify, and he's helped build our open-source program since it's inception.

    "title": "Feature Driven Design: Microfrontends’ Best Friend (Chase App) - Sandra Jurek | React Native EU 2023",
    "description": "📖 About the talk \n\nOver the last few years, the idea of creating front-end applications implementing the microfrontends design approach became increasingly popular. Not surprisingly – developing the application in a modular way empowers the teams to work with their own pace and take more ownership of the code they write. It can also significantly speed up the delivery of features across the project, as long as it is implemented well. In the very beginning, a lot of React Native projects started off as monolithic apps. Even now, when looking for a starter template for a React Native application, it is likely to come across the examples that suggest dividing the code based on its type – screens, components, hooks, helpers, utils, etc. A division that is perfectly suitable for small projects, but in the long run will not be able to guarantee the scalability of fast-growing ones. One that might result in difficult to detect cyclic dependencies, can delay the release of the product due to a simple defect in one of the packages or forces all the teams to use the same tools and boilerplates. Following the principles of feature driven design can help to take the project one step further, offering the possibility to scale it based on – as the name suggests – the development of the features included in it. Not necessarily features commonly understood in the context of the agile methodology, but the product features – the ones that describe the characteristics of what a particular area in the product (and correspondingly in the codebase) is responsible for.\n\n🗣 Speaker Bio\n\nSandra is a robotics engineer turned frontend engineer in JPMorgan Chase. Her key responsibilities involve leading the design system implementation and being responsible for the frontend architecture of the application. Her experience includes working on projects for leading UK brands, such as Wagamama, Jaguar Land Rover, Boots and Nando’s.

Optional 'unsafe' language extensions enable direct manipulation of native types and APIs, reducing the need to shift to C++ and allowing for a predominantly single-language codebase.

    "description": "Asynchronous rendering is one of the core principles of React. On the web, the ability to batch updates and work on a virtual DOM proved to be key factors in improving rendering performance. The same architecture seems to do miracles in React Native and gives JavaScript the performance boost needed to render native views effectively. This benefit of React Native is also its greatest drawback. For certain types of problems in native mobile, asynchronous rendering introduces an overhead that is almost impossible to bridge. List views are a good example, as even the best implementation to date, FlatList, struggles to keep up with the fill rate of the most naive list implementation in pure native. Is it possible to introduce synchronous rendering to React Native and tackle this category of problems from a different direction?\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland.",

    "description": "React Native is great product but lacks for stable, intuitive and easy navigation API during many years. Every year we see new, better API: Native Navigator, ex-Navigator, NavigationExperimental, ex-Navigation, wix native navigation, airbnb native navigation, ReactNavigation… Once I've started React Native development, in 2015, I created RNRF - simple API for easy navigation. It was clear that better navigation instruments will come later but I didn't want to change my code again and again to switch for better API. Every new major version of RNRF is based on different navigation framework and mostly preserves own API. Another goal was to represent all navigation flow within one place in clear, human-readable way - similar to iOS Storyboards concept. This way other engineers could understand your app flow faster. I want to talk about latest version (v4) of RNRF based on ReactNavigation and MobX and provide best practices. New version provides not only navigation solution but also proposes a way to manage your app state.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland.",

React Native provides a way of using React for native development, but also introduces a couple of APIs for interacting with native modules, and these are not declarative. It is not always clear where to call these APIs from, and usually they end up in lifecycle hooks or redux middlewares in an unstructured style. In this talk we will see how Cycle.js (or in general, a hexagonal architecture) can help manage both React components and Native APIs in a declarative fashion, to organize code and make it more testable.\n\nThis talk was presented at React Native EU 2017, September 6-7, Wroclaw, Poland.",

    "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nWhile developing mobile applications we usually have a mental model of a single runnable piece of software that includes all features and there’s a good reason for that - it’s difficult to split functionality in native mobile applications. However, with React Native most of our logic lives as a JavaScript, which can be splitted. The web development community has been doing that for years. So what if we could split our React Native code using the power of Webpack?\n\nPaweł Trysła aka. Zamotany is a software engineer at Callstack and the lead engineer at Re.Pack. Paweł calls himself “the tooling guy” with extensive knowledge of Webpack and Babel. He is also a huge fan of Electron, functional programming and RxJS.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_zamotany \n\nGithub: https://github.com/zamotany",

Starting with what the VoIP actually is, going through some theory of WebRTC connections, and ending with the CallKit of iOS vs Android way of handling calls with the React Native. It will give you a sneak peek of what is required to make a production app that handles outgoing and incoming calls and what kind of infrastructure you need. The talk is based on the experience taken from the phone app made for sales and support teams around the world.\n\nWojciech is a JavaScript developer, trainer, and mentor.

    "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nThis talk is targeted developers creating apps for a Bluetooth device, such as a loudspeaker, a toothbrush or a dishwasher. I report on my experience using the technique of \"mock recording\" to get very fast and robust integration tests. \n\nIn collaboration with SOUNDBOKS, a Bluetooth speaker company, I have developed an open source tool for creating and using recordings of Bluetooth (BLE) traffic to test a React Native app using Jest. The tool makes it possible to run several integration tests per second as opposed to several minutes per end-to-end test. The tool is based on years of production experience using mock recording for web traffic. \n\nIn this talk I introduce the methodology, perform a live demonstration of the tool, and report on our experience using the tool during app development: how is the quality and speed of feedback from these tests, and how easy is the tool to use for developers? \n\nThe tool is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ble-plx-mock-recorder.\n\n\nLars is an experienced software developer, architect and coach. Lars is an expert in fast and robust test automation with a track record of successfully running 200+ integration tests per second.

It should go without asking. Syncing states, adding the support of screen readers and keyboard interactions can be cumbersome. My team and I have built a set of React hooks that make it easy to build accessible React Native and Web components that complies with the WAI-ARIA standards.

    "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nAnimation is a crucial element of modern mobile UI development. The JS-to-Native bridge that makes React Native so great also has implications for animation, since declarative and performant animations should be declared on one side of the bridge and executed on the other while making as few trips across the bridge as possible.\nIn this talk, I'll introduce an animation tool, React Native Reanimated 2, and how it helps simplify this mental model for performant animations while providing power-user tools for complex animations. I'll provide some real-world use-cases for Reanimated 2, and how it can fit into your React Native workflow even if you're not an animation expert.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nI am a software engineer that loves using JS to make cool things. I am focused primarily on mobile app development work with React Native, but I also try to stay up to date with the happenings in the web front-end space. I have a formal background in mathematics and education which has led to a soft spot for mobile UX and animation.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gksander93\nGithub: https://github.com/gksander\n\nAdditional links:\nSlides and demo materials from the talk:\nhttps://github.com/gksander/rn-eu-2021-reanimated.",

    "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nA year ago, I challenged myself to practice TDD on my React Native application all the time for two weeks.\n\nAt first, I was afraid, then I was petrified. \nI kept thinking I could never write tests that my code would abide. \nBut then I spent so many nights thinking about what testing is and how I was doing it wrong. \nAnd I grew strong. \n\nI became more confident writing tests with React Native Testing Library. After two weeks I realized that it was one of the best decisions I had ever made. One year later I would never go back, and I believe a lot of developers would benefit from it as well. \n\nIn this talk I am going to cover:\n- a quick reminder of what TDD is\n- how to use 100% TDD (yes, even with components!) on a React Native app by developing a HackerNews clone in RN\n- why switching to TDD made me a lot faster\n- why TDD made my code healthier\n- in which conditions I would recommend not using TDD\n\nMy goal is to lower the barrier to start using TDD with React Native and to convince other developers to give it a try!\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\"Louis Zawadzki has been developing React Native apps of different sizes and shapes since 2017. \nHe became a developer after he heard that \"a server is like a computer, but without a mouse nor a screen,\" and was intrigued to know what kind of superpowers developers had to do something with no mouse and no screen.\n\n\"Life is too short to click on simulators\" could be his motto, hence his love for TDD and building easily changeable and testable architectures.\n\nHe is also passionate about many things such as German rock music from the 70s, storefront typography and fig rolls.\"\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zawadzkil\nGithub: https://github.com/louiszawadzki\n\nAdditional links:\n\"A catalog of TDD recipes for React Native: https://louiszawadzki.github.io/react-native-tdd/\n\nAn article I wrote about how TDD had such an impact on my career: https://blog.bam.tech/developer-news/software-development-learning-path\"",

    "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract: \nMost of the people watching this talk have some sort of connection to React-Native, either by playing around with it or by doing it professionally. This talk will show alternative approach on how to build React-Native apps which you might not have tried before or even though of.  My story started two years ago, together with a friend we made an app to scratch our own itch, we wanted to listen to more podcasts. One of the things we tried was to listen to podcast while working out, which works fine when you go slow or rest between sets, but when you're going at it, it's hard to focus on the podcast or if you focus on the podcast you can get injured (I once started laughing from podcast in the middle of a squat rep, I do not recommend that 😅). Our solution was to create an app that plays music when you go at it and plays podcast when you rest or go slow - combined with a workout timer.\n\nThe interesting part here is that both playing music and podcast is done using native iOS and Android code. Together with playing audio we also have to run the workout timer on the native thread so if the app is put to background the timer still runs. The way we started architecture this app was to have a control center on the javascript side that emits events to the native side when its time to play music and when its time to play podcast, as well as an event listing to the timer running on the native thread. \n\nEmitting events back and fourth over the bridge just to keep the native and the javascript in sync is not sufficient and error prone. So we did what any sane developer would do, we did a re-write! We moved all the logic from the control center to the native side and we also moved the counter UI to the native side.\n\nIn this talk I will go through how we did it from an Android perspective and I hope you might think of ways to optimise your app by levering the native side 🤞🏼\n\nSpeaker bio: \nBeen building software products for the last 10 years. I've been shipping more than five different apps using React-Native and I have been part of teams maintaining several React-Native apps for years.

    "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nThere are multiple solutions if you want to work with animations in React Native. Each solution has its advantages and disadvantages. In this talk, you will get to know Animated, Reanimated 2, and Lottie, each solution with detailed code examples and recommended use cases for this solution. We will animate Image list headers with scale, translate and change opacity using Animated, change the height, position, and opacity onScroll using Reanimated 2 and use code-controlled Lottie-Animations to animate characters. You will not only learn how to create such beautiful animations but also how to do it that they run at 60fps on every device. \n\nABout the speaker:\nAlexander is the owner of Horizon Alpha. He loves working on awesome React Native apps and the corresponding cloud-based backends.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AlexanderKuttig",

And what are you excited about the most?\n18:47 What was your favorite topic at React Native EU 2021 conference?\n22:15 What's coming up with the new React Native Architecture? What's the connection between JSI, TurbuModules, and Fabric?\n24:26 When the re-architecture (TurboModules, Fabric) rollout will be available\nto the community? And will users be able to use it while working with React Native 0.67?\n28:54 What is the largest number of platforms you run React Native on in production? How much real code sharing is there? And what are the drawbacks of maintaining many platforms?\n33:09 What are your thoughts on React Native support for wearOS? Or wearables in general? And what do you believe are the limitations of this implementation?\n35:06 VR/AR experiences with React Native. What’s the plan for making VR/AR constructs exposed to React Native?\n36:56 Can I use React Navigation in React Native Windows, MacOS, etc.?\n37:31 With React Native being available on so many platforms, how do you envision the library ecosystem and native code in them?\n41:43 What does it take to develop and maintain a big Open Source library?\n47:02 Does Re.Pack support Hermes engine?\n49:48 Should the Reanimated library be brought into React Native core? It seems to be, de facto, the standard when it comes to creating animations.\n53:05 What are the React Native Core and Microsoft teams collaborating on these days?\n55:58 Would you recommend using UI frameworks like React Native Paper, etc., to build a scalable and maintainable app rather than building the UI from scratch? And why?\n59:12 Where do you see React Native in 5 years? And why do you think Airbnb dropped it?",

        "description": "ReactNext 2023\nwww.react-next.com\nIsrael's Annual React & React-Native conference\n\nPowered by EventHandler\n\nDebugging debugging; why we must approach debugging differently\n\nIntermediate | English\nDebugging, in its various forms, has been around for as long as people have been developing code. It is a critical step in the creation and maintenance of code. No matter what it is that you are developing, you will undoubtedly have an array of issues, and debugging enables you to get to the bottom of these; to find the bug and to then find a fix for it.\n\nBut debugging, as we know it, is broken. It takes time, it is always a struggle to get the exact data you want, and worst of all, you are often called to debug at the most inconvenient times.\n\nIn this talk, we will delve into the reasons why debugging techniques are broken. Why a method that was developed last century is no longer relevant (or useful) to our ever evolving technology stacks of today, and what advances have been made in the space to ensure that everyone can use the right tools for the right use case. We will delve into the finer details of how tools empower teams to take real ownership and how, by addressing the biggest pain points associated with traditional debugging techniques, we can rebrand it to a task that developers would want to take on.\n\n\nElinor Sapir\nSolution Engineer\n\nElinor is the Director Solutions Engineering at Rookout. Originally hailing from New Zealand, she is passionate about making sure people increase the adoption of new and cutting-edge technology. When she’s not promoting new tech, you can find her exploring new places or at the beach.",

The popular testing-library package is a widely used tool that helps developers write reliable and maintainable frontend tests based on a behavior driven approach, but many users are not fully aware of how it works or why it works the way it does. In this talk, I, as one of the maintainers of the package, give an in-depth look into the testing-library ecosystem, including its structure and foundations. I explain how we built a solution that can be used in every framework, and how you can use it in both Node and browser environments. You will learn how testing-library is designed to encourage good testing practices and how it can help you write more maintainable tests.\n\n\nMatan Borenkraout\nSenior Software Engineer\n\nMatan is a Software Engineer at Microsoft, the co-organiser of the “Big web theory” meetup and a tech blog writer. He is a React enthusiast and a Testing Library maintainer who's aiming to understand how things work rather than satisfying on a given API.

Our developer spotted the opportunity and suggested we use a Face Detection algorithm to generate a “Smart Crop” feature that automatically detects the best way to crop the images our users provide.\nThe result shocked even our most optimistic analysts. (#4 will shock you)\n\nIn this talk we’ll dive deep into the way we detected this opportunity, what we tried to solve and the mistakes we made along the way until we came up with our current solution of combining React with Tensorflow for frontend machine-learning face detection.\n\nI hope that after the talk you too will feel inspired to think outside the box and come up with solutions that create extreme impact within your team.\n\n\nRon Hagafny\nSoftware Engineer\n\nEver since I learned to code by hacking online flash games at 16, I've been enthusiastic about code and the ability to create anything from an idea. After serving as a Software Developer at Unit 81, I joined a company called Guester and served as VP R&D for 3 years. During my time in the company, we won the Nightlife Entrepreneurs of the Year award. During my studies of Computer Science at IDC, I took part in the Zell Entrepreneurship Program, a program aimed toward top students with the goal of forming teams and creating Startups. Today, I work as a Software Engineer in Mixtiles. Besides my work as a Full-stack Developer, I love creating video games.",

        "description": "ReactNext 2023\nwww.react-next.com\nIsrael's Annual React & React-Native conference\n\nPowered by EventHandler\n\nOvercoming the Performance Cost of Hydration\n\nIntermediate | English\n\nModern JavaScript frameworks overcame the rendering performance limitations of Single-Page Applications (SPAs) by introducing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). Unfortunately at the same time they created a potentially worse problem: unresponsive user interfaces. This is due to the requirement to hydrate UIs provided by SSR / SSG using client-side JavaScript before they can respond to user interactions. Recently frameworks have started to tackle this issue using a variety of different approaches. These approaches include: islands of hydration, selective hydration, server-side components, progressive enhancement, render slicing, edge computing, and resumability. In this talk I will describe these approaches, and highlight their benefits and limitations. Together we will try to determine which approach is likely to win out.\n\n\nDan Shappir\nPerformance Tech Lead\n\nDan Shappir is the Performance Tech Lead at NEXT Insurance.

It’s been a learning process to correctly format strings, numbers, dates, times, currencies, calendars, x/y axis, and more!\n\nIn this talk, Naomi shares some of the useful techniques she has learned about customizing data visualizations for a global audience. With a focus on React and high level ideas to keep in mind when designing, coding, testing, internationalizing, and localizing data visualizations for the world!\n\nNaomi Meyer\nNaomi works as a Software Development Engineer at Adobe in New York City, where she is the product champion for internationalization (i18n) on her team. Before writing JavaScript full time, Naomi worked teaching English as a foreign language in local classrooms across Asia and West Africa. She is passionate about developing with diversity, inclusion, and internationalization (i18n) in mind, and enjoys hiking and riding bikes on the weekends.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

At Twilio we’ve been building REST APIs for over 10 years. When we recently decided to ship Twilio Flex, a software that has a working UI out of the box, we still wanted to make sure that it was as flexible as the rest of our APIs.\n\nIn this talk we’ll dive into how we architected a programmable UI platform using React that both allows you to have a fully working UI out of the box but also be able to customize every functionality and user experience to your needs using the full power of React.\n\nNarendra Shetty\nNarendra works at Twilio as Senior Software Engineer. He is working on building Twilio Flex which is a programmable UI product. Previously worked at Booking.com.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Over the years companies and developers have invested a lot of time and money in development of UI components based on VanillaJS or various frameworks. Building components is time consuming, has integration and maintenance risks, and worst of all, distracts developers from the task at hand - actually building the application. In this presentation, you will learn how to quickly and easily “Reactify” your existing JavaScript components to use them in React applications.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

They cannot do anything. The only perception you can feel is as hot as a hell metal case of the laptop. Although this sounds like a horror movie, this is your application that cannot leverage modern APIs to lift heavy computation to a different thread where consequently user suffers the pain.\n\nModern features like Web Workers, WebAssembly, Worklets, and Service Worker allow us to leverage multithreading computing to run tasks parallelly which at the end, makes the user feel like in a rainbow paradise instead of a nightmare, even though JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language!\n\nIn this session, Majid shows his experience running jobs in parallel on a React.js application that will provide a pleasant user experience and exciting development.\n\nMajid Hajian\nMajid Hajian is a passionate software developer with years of developing and architecting complex web and mobile applications. He is passionate about web platform especially flutter, IoT, PWAs, and performance. He loves sharing his knowledge with the community by writing and speaking, contributing to open source and organizing meetups and events.\nMajid is the author of \"Progressive web app with Angular\" book by Apress and \"Progressive Web Apps\" video course by PacktPub and Udemy. He is (co)organizer of a few mobile and web meetups in Norway as well as Nordic conferences for mobile and Angular, Mobile Era and ngVikings.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Nothing in React prevents us from building accessible web apps, but we need to learn to harness its power in the right way while dealing with some unique challenges caused by creating web pages with JavaScript. This talk will focus on these issues and how to solve them in the real world, while also adding some a11y power to your development process. This talk will also focus on why it is important to build accessible web apps.\n\nManjula Dube\nManjula loves contributing to OSS in her free time. She loves teaching and believes it is best way to learn more and more. She is one of the organisers for React India.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

But is it this simple? Will a design system make magically your product more accessible? Let’s see together the good things and the pain points of ensuring the accessibility of your product through a design system.\n\nAbout Damien (https://twitter.com/iamhiwelo)\nA queer Design systems & Accessibility lead working in the healthcare industry for Castor EDC. Speaker, teacher and passionate about too many things, fighting every day for a more inclusive web.\n\nThrough different projects, Damien is trying to make the Web a more inclusive and accessible place, while focusing on collaboration and mentoring. By the way, Damien's agender, so their pronouns are they/them.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In this lightning talk, I'll be showing you implementation differences between the behavior of native HTML elements and their DIV counterparts.\n\nJen Luker \nJen is a Sr. Frontend Engineer, conference speaker, and BookBytes podcast co-host. She has spent the majority of her career as a full-stack developer using PHP, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular fondness for frontend technologies. She is an advocate for both accessibility, and processes that make doing the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard. When she's not exploring solutions, learning new technologies, or reading, Jen's spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting; she's even been known to 3D print her own tools for the job. She is also fascinated by all things space, antique cars, and IoT.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

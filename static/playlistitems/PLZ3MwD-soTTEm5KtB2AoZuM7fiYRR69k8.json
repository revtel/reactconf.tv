It was just a regular day for the ‚Äúrelease crew‚Äù as we were approaching to prepare the first release candidate for React Native 0.71. Little did we know how an innocuous release could have triggered a domino effect resulting in failing builds for nearly every React Native developer out there. With the wisdom of hindsight, we‚Äôll walk through what happened, what are our lessons learned and the lowlights of this incident. We‚Äôll have the opportunity to look through the internals of React Native, discover our incident-response culture, and learn how we‚Äôre hardening our ecosystem to protect us against similar events in the future. Join me as we revive this incident, and don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to gain insights, be inspired, and embrace the lessons learned from the day I broke React Native.\n\nüó£ Speaker Bio\n\nNicola Corti is a Google Developer Expert for Kotlin. He has been working with the language since before version 1.0, and he is the maintainer of several open-source libraries and tools for mobile developers. He's currently working in the React Native Core team at Meta, building one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Furthermore, he is an active member of the developer community. His involvement goes from speaking at international conferences to being a member of CFP committees and supporting developer communities across Europe. In his free time, he also loves baking, podcasting, and running.\n\nGet your tickets for React Native EU 2024:\nhttps://ti.to/react-native-eu/react-native-eu-2024/\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference: \nhttps://www.react-native.eu/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nVisit the organizer's website: \nhttps://www.callstack.com/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

        "description": "üìñ About the talk \n\nExpensify's mission is to \"Live Rich, Have Fun, Save the World\", and at a high level that means building a community of people who come together to solve humanity‚Äôs urgent challenges. This guiding principle has informed the decision to rebuild Expensify's product as a next-gen collaboration tool, from the ground up with a fully open-source front-end. This approach gives us access to specialized talent, enables us to scale up our engineering capacity without expanding the internal team, and ultimately preserves Expensify's tight-knit culture, keeping us laser-focused on our long-term vision. In this speech, we'll take a tour of Expensify's open-source contribution program and demonstrate how the company engages a global network of contributors to build features, fix bugs, and ultimately build a better product. Our commitment to communal ownership of our dependencies, and the drive to build up the entire React Native community, ties into our long-term goal to build a community that empowers people to \"Get Shit Done.\" We'll discuss in detail how the program works, including the various roles we‚Äôve made available for external contributors, how they can get paid to contribute, and some lessons learned along the way. Join us as we explore how Expensify is building bridges with open-source and React Native, and how this approach aligns with our mission to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nüó£ Speaker Bio\nRory Abraham is a Full Stack developer at Expensify, and he's helped build our open-source program since it's inception. He spends a huge portion of his time working with developers from all across the React Native community to help Expensify build their product and, importantly, to improve their dependencies.\n\nGet your tickets for React Native EU 2024:\nhttps://ti.to/react-native-eu/react-native-eu-2024/\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference: \nhttps://www.react-native.eu/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nVisit the organizer's website: \nhttps://www.callstack.com/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

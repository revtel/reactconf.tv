It was just a regular day for the ‚Äúrelease crew‚Äù as we were approaching to prepare the first release candidate for React Native 0.71. Little did we know how an innocuous release could have triggered a domino effect resulting in failing builds for nearly every React Native developer out there. With the wisdom of hindsight, we‚Äôll walk through what happened, what are our lessons learned and the lowlights of this incident. We‚Äôll have the opportunity to look through the internals of React Native, discover our incident-response culture, and learn how we‚Äôre hardening our ecosystem to protect us against similar events in the future. Join me as we revive this incident, and don‚Äôt miss this opportunity to gain insights, be inspired, and embrace the lessons learned from the day I broke React Native.\n\nüó£ Speaker Bio\n\nNicola Corti is a Google Developer Expert for Kotlin. He has been working with the language since before version 1.0, and he is the maintainer of several open-source libraries and tools for mobile developers. He's currently working in the React Native Core team at Meta, building one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Furthermore, he is an active member of the developer community. His involvement goes from speaking at international conferences to being a member of CFP committees and supporting developer communities across Europe. In his free time, he also loves baking, podcasting, and running.\n\nGet your tickets for React Native EU 2024:\nhttps://ti.to/react-native-eu/react-native-eu-2024/\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference: \nhttps://www.react-native.eu/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nVisit the organizer's website: \nhttps://www.callstack.com/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

        "description": "üìñ About the talk \n\nExpensify's mission is to \"Live Rich, Have Fun, Save the World\", and at a high level that means building a community of people who come together to solve humanity‚Äôs urgent challenges. This guiding principle has informed the decision to rebuild Expensify's product as a next-gen collaboration tool, from the ground up with a fully open-source front-end. This approach gives us access to specialized talent, enables us to scale up our engineering capacity without expanding the internal team, and ultimately preserves Expensify's tight-knit culture, keeping us laser-focused on our long-term vision. In this speech, we'll take a tour of Expensify's open-source contribution program and demonstrate how the company engages a global network of contributors to build features, fix bugs, and ultimately build a better product. Our commitment to communal ownership of our dependencies, and the drive to build up the entire React Native community, ties into our long-term goal to build a community that empowers people to \"Get Shit Done.\" We'll discuss in detail how the program works, including the various roles we‚Äôve made available for external contributors, how they can get paid to contribute, and some lessons learned along the way. Join us as we explore how Expensify is building bridges with open-source and React Native, and how this approach aligns with our mission to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nüó£ Speaker Bio\nRory Abraham is a Full Stack developer at Expensify, and he's helped build our open-source program since it's inception. He spends a huge portion of his time working with developers from all across the React Native community to help Expensify build their product and, importantly, to improve their dependencies.\n\nGet your tickets for React Native EU 2024:\nhttps://ti.to/react-native-eu/react-native-eu-2024/\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference: \nhttps://www.react-native.eu/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nVisit the organizer's website: \nhttps://www.callstack.com/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

        "title": "Feature Driven Design: Microfrontends‚Äô Best Friend (Chase App) - Sandra Jurek | React Native EU 2023",
        "description": "üìñ About the talk \n\nOver the last few years, the idea of creating front-end applications implementing the microfrontends design approach became increasingly popular. Not surprisingly ‚Äì developing the application in a modular way empowers the teams to work with their own pace and take more ownership of the code they write. It can also significantly speed up the delivery of features across the project, as long as it is implemented well. In the very beginning, a lot of React Native projects started off as monolithic apps. Even now, when looking for a starter template for a React Native application, it is likely to come across the examples that suggest dividing the code based on its type ‚Äì screens, components, hooks, helpers, utils, etc. A division that is perfectly suitable for small projects, but in the long run will not be able to guarantee the scalability of fast-growing ones. One that might result in difficult to detect cyclic dependencies, can delay the release of the product due to a simple defect in one of the packages or forces all the teams to use the same tools and boilerplates. Following the principles of feature driven design can help to take the project one step further, offering the possibility to scale it based on ‚Äì as the name suggests ‚Äì the development of the features included in it. Not necessarily features commonly understood in the context of the agile methodology, but the product features ‚Äì the ones that describe the characteristics of what a particular area in the product (and correspondingly in the codebase) is responsible for.\n\nüó£ Speaker Bio\n\nSandra is a robotics engineer turned frontend engineer in JPMorgan Chase. Her key responsibilities involve leading the design system implementation and being responsible for the frontend architecture of the application. Her experience includes working on projects for leading UK brands, such as Wagamama, Jaguar Land Rover, Boots and Nando‚Äôs. In her free time, she enjoys playing board games and creative crafts.\n\nGet your tickets for React Native EU 2024:\nhttps://ti.to/react-native-eu/react-native-eu-2024/\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference: \nhttps://www.react-native.eu/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nVisit the organizer's website: \nhttps://www.callstack.com/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social\n\nFollow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

The cornerstone feature is the optional compilation of type-annotated JavaScript into native code, offering predictable performance on par with C/C++. It supports an arbitrary mix of native and interpreted code, both typed and untyped. Optional 'unsafe' language extensions enable direct manipulation of native types and APIs, reducing the need to shift to C++ and allowing for a predominantly single-language codebase. These advancements merge native-like power with the flexibility and convenience of JavaScript.

Not only must websites be feature-rich and robust, they must load and run quickly on a near-infinite variety of devices and browsers all around the world. Oh, and do it with limited team members on an aggressive timeline. Come join Kyle Mathews, founder of Gatsby, as he talks about modern web performance. You'll learn the tools & techniques you can start using today to make your React sites super fast. We’ll discuss code splitting, \"link preload\", greedy prefetching, header optimizations, service workers, and more using Gatsby as a case study for these techniques.\n\nKyle is a tech entrepreneur based in San Francisco, CA. He's founded several startups and is now helping build a next generation open source JavaScript website framework called Gatsby that blends the speed and simplicity of static sites with the rich tooling and client-side capabilities of React.js.",

        "description": "At Docker, we are using GraphQL alongside our existing REST APIs and making it work without a GraphQL server. Instead, we use GraphQL client side, where it serves as the interface to our network layer and the glue that binds our components together. We have taken this approach as a progressive solution to the difficult problem of introducing GraphQL to an existing application stack. By breaking the rules a bit we gain many of the benefits that GraphQL provides immediately while spreading out the implementation over many releases. While a novel approach I also envision a future where running GraphQL on the client is not uncommon. With the advent of blockchain technology and the concept of “dapps” we must reconsider the role of the application that runs on the end user’s device. By running GraphQL on the client we can consume remote GraphQL services, interact directly with the blockchain, browser / native APIs, and more through GraphQL.\n\nTyler is an engineer at Docker working on UI applications. When not writing code you can find him at a beach near his home in San Francisco.",

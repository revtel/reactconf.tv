        "description": "ReactNext 2019\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n@reactnext\n\nI’m With Web Components and Web Components Are With Me\n\nGil Fink\n\nWeb development changed dramatically during the last years. With the enormous amount of JavaScript libraries and the new HTML5 standard, today it is much easier to create web apps. \n\nWhen building a web app, you will probably want to reuse some of the web components you built. But how can you do that with the current state of HTML? One of the new and emerging web standards is Web Components. The Web Components standard enables you to create reusable web components that include HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Can we use Web Components with React or vise versa? This session will answer this question and explain the why and how to do such a thing.\n\nGil is a web development expert, Microsoft MVP and sparXys CEO. He is currently consulting for various enterprises and companies, where he helps to develop web and RIA-based solutions. He conducts lectures and workshops for individuals and enterprises who want to specialize in infrastructure and web development. He is also co-author of several Microsoft Official Courses (MOCs) and training kits, co-author of Pro Single Page Application Development book (Apress), co-organiser of GDG Rashlatz Meetup and Angular UP conference.",

        "description": "ReactNext 2019\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n@reactnext\n\nBuilding large scale apps in the last years, lead me to a development process that provides rapid results and ability to scale. I want to show these technics, building a real world react app, using storybook, with DDD (design-driven development) and atomic design. \n\nBuilding an app is a complicated task. It starts with the flow from the product moving to design and then to the RND. However, it does not stop there, there is a need to go back and forth with the process as specs and design might change. Using DDD, we can leverage the ability to describe the spec visually, for the product and other stakeholders.\n\nUsing atomic design, we can create our MVP fast and ready for scale. Oppose to design systems, Atomic design gives us the granularity we need, and a way to compose our app parts very fast and stable.\n\nAlon is a Senior Tech Lead @TWiK\nA JavaScript enthusiast with a mentorship core and a 100% hands-on approach.",

        "description": "ReactNext 2019\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n@reactnext\n\nRedux-sagas became a pretty common tool to handle asynchronous actions in the react-redux ecosystem. However, often I saw that not all asynchronous events are handled with it although redux-sagas have event channels which allow you to listen and react to any asynchronous routine (e.g. socket connections or external signals) and not just redux actions. \n\nExpect some live coding in this talk: We will implement a redux-saga event channel to catch signals of bluetooth beacons (why on earth do I try a hardware live demo!). Besides, this talk want to strengthen your understanding of generator functions (the backbone of redux-sagas). To this end, we will dive into a naive implementation of async-await to understand generator functions, and as a result, redux-sagas better.\n\nAs a freelancer software engineer, André builds and improves React and React Native apps. In his projects he often introduces new tools and puts an emphasis on clean code. He worked a lot with bluetooth beacon technology and created a popular open-source library in this field. As data scientist he digs through data and tries to discover interesting relations. You can often find André at hackathons, which he already successfully participated in 19 times. If he doesn’t code, André teaches kids how to program at science festivals all around the world or explains scientific topics to general audiences at science slams throughout Germany.",

        "description": "ReactNext 2019\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n@reactnext\n\nDeveloping forms can quickly become complex, and the myriad of approaches and libraries only highlights the problem - there's so many different use-cases and no one-size-fits-all solution. It's time to formally model our forms. In this talk, we'll explore the current React form landscape and learn how hooks and state machines can be used to create abstract models of complex forms that greatly reduce dependencies on restrictive form libraries or complex custom components. With these abstract models, form logic can be automatically tested, simulated, analyzed, and visualized.\n\nDavid Khourshid is a software engineer for Microsoft, a tech author, and speaker. He is passionate about statecharts and software modeling (and created the XState library), reactive animations, innovative user interfaces, and cutting-edge front-end technologies When not behind a computer keyboard, he’s behind a piano keyboard or traveling.",

You fix it and merge the code to your production branch. Congratulations! now it’s time for your code to meet your users. In a mobile app that means you just entered a few days (at least) of a build-test-fix cycle, and if that’s not enough you now have to wait for the store review of your new version. That means you wait for a week, if everything went smoothly, just for a small UI fix. That’s the nightmare of CI/CD on mobile apps. In Soluto we developed Dynamico. An OTA javascript code delivery framework that allows you to load React components dynamically. Come and learn how you can start using it to safely move faster!\n\n\nElad Bezalel is a fullstack developer with a very strong love for design. Since 8 years old, he's been designing in Photoshop and later on fell in love with programming. This strong bond between design and computer programming gave birth to a new kind of love. And he is currently doing the combination of both focused on implementing immersive UI and UX.\n\nElad Aviv is a fullstack developer, who traveled a long way from native iOS development through the dark times of the web into this new era of JS based native apps.

        "description": "ReactNext 2019\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n@reactnext\n\nDOM Reconciliation is the process of making the rendered page match the React component tree. Reusing elements is important for performance, and many of the best practices for building React apps emerge from the reconciliation process. Let’s break things to figure out how they work. \n\nIn this talk we’ll look at an app that does everything wrong. As we fix the problems, we’ll see how React is able reuse more DOM nodes and reconcile the component tree and the DOM faster, recreating fewer nodes. By the end we’ll have a model for reconciliation that will give us a solid foundation for remembering best practices and building performant applications.\n\nJesse is a systems engineer at Cloudflare. He works on data and security products and previously worked on Cloudflare Stream. He started doing web development in the late 1990's and has worked the full stack from front-end development to managing memory allocation in C++. He has a young family and is an avid runner and rock climber.",

Go get yourself a victory cookie. \n\nOh wait, you can’t, because a legion of designers and motion artists are headed your way chanting something about “storyboards” and “microinteractions”. How will that even fit in with your beautiful architecture? \n\nUnlike state changes which can be instantaneous, animations inherently take time to complete - and that’s a big problem.

        "description": "ReactNext 2019\n@reactnext\nwww.react-next.com\nTel Aviv, Israel\n\nFor most of us, “static sites” only work for simple sites, like personal blogs. But static sites can do so much more! In this talk, learn how Gatsby uses React and GraphQL to help you build apps that combine the performance and workflow benefits of static sites with the flexibility and power of server-driven sites, all in a modern dev stack!\n\nDustin is from the middle of America: Omaha, Nebraska. He’s happy to report that it’s not _only_ cows and cornfields. He works for an awesome startup GatsbyJS: an excellent, blazing-fast app generator for React. You can find him regularly working on all things open source and all things JavaScript.",

In the last year I created and currently hosting one of the best podcast for programmers in Israel and created until now 20+ episodes (React, Node.js, Deep Learning, Kubernetes and many more).

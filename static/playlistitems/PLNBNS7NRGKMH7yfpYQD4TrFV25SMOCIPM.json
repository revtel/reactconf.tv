This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

That’s one of the sentences that every front end developer fears the most. There are many DnD libraries out there but did you ever consider building something from scratch before adding additional 100kB to your bundle?\n\nLet’s take a look what tools browsers offer today. You can build beautiful and accessible experiences while supporting mobile devices and not sacrificing the performance!

If we can’t read our own code after a few months, how can we expect anybody else to? What kind of effect does this have on developer productivity and overall project robustness? This talk explores how Emma and her team were able to make a client’s React codebase more readable and improve communication and productivity by leveraging technologies like TypeScript, GraphQL, and React hooks in a rewrite of the client's website.\n\nIncrease the speed at which new developers are able to onboard to your project, cut down on the time between when a PR is submitted and when it’s merged, and streamline the bug squashing process.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Even though it's based on a type system, GraphQL in many ways is more flexible than REST. But the flexibility that makes GraphQL a joy to work with can have its downsides if you aren't careful.\n\nSchema design is an area where one small oversight at the beginning can get you stuck having to deal with weird naming, bloated duplicates, and other annoying workarounds. It doesn't have to be like this! \n\nNik Graf has extensive experience designing GraphQL schemas, for a variety of business applications.Nik has prepared several examples following different design patterns. Through exploration and comparison, you'll come away with actionable knowledge for designing and extending schemas.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions. In this talk you will learn how to do that and see a real-world example.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Now it is possible to build, train and use ML models directly in browser. But the efficiency of ML model highly depends on the features that it is using. React allows to reinforce ML feature engineering process. It is great for displaying fast-changing data in web and let to visualize features, model’s layers and weights in a run-time during model training that gives useful insides on how features correspond to the result, what are good features and what features could be removed. During the session we will use React-based model visualization to pick the best features to predict results of soccer matches played at the FIFA World Cups. We will check count of matches that team have won and lost, count of wins and loses against a particular competitor, goal differences, stage, etc. We will validate our model using matches results from the last Mundial in Russia in 2018.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

During this time, we’ve observed more progression than ever before towards the vision of a cross-platform mobile solution. Even still, we have yet to realise its core mission of being as powerful as pure native. There have been many challenges that we’ve faced head on as they’ve surfaced. In overcoming them with the support of the community, we’ve managed to establish React Native as a force that is now defining the future of the segment.\n\nExplore this history-in-the-making before diving deeper into more technical subjects including the JSI & JSC upgrade, TurboModules & Fabric, and the CodeGen. With all the pieces of the puzzle in place and landing on master by end of the year, we are closer to reaching our original objective than ever before - while pushing the limits to a whole new level.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

We’ll start in 2005, when academia researchers first started exploring the idea of adding a strongly typed system on top of JavaScript. We’ll walk through the complications at hand (with plenty of examples), and understand the design goals of both TypeScript and Flow. After understanding the state of the art, we’ll briefly go over what’s going to change in this space over the next few years.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You announce the conference, start planning the venue, getting sponsors, & fielding talks. Things start getting serious, & before you know it you’re overloaded with obligations. Oh, & you forgot: You also need a conference app!\n\nYou don’t just want any conference app; you want it to be fun, engaging, & a valuable addition to the attendees. How can you do this in the least amount of time?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show how you can rapidly prototype, build, & deploy your app using GraphQL, React Native, & AWS AppSync so you can spend your time worrying about more important things in life. In addition to what you’d expect from a conference app, we’ll be adding live chat so attendees discuss talks & speakers can field questions & interact with them in real-time.\"\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

The main hurdle for web developers coming to mobile development (native apps with React native or PWAs) is handling offline capabilities.\n\nJosh speaks firsthand about this learning curve, the pitfalls and realisations of doing this in production apps. As an architect developer at Theodo, he has seen developers struggle with this mindset switch on their projects over the past 2 years, and wants to share their learnings!\n\nJosh speaks about:\n- Optimistic UX updating\n- Data persistence between app/server\n- Offline mode (request queuing)\n- Reconciling updates after this\"\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

After all, they’re both all about being in charge - who gets to render, who gets to update, who gets to decide how things should look... the story goes on and on. But with these two, as in life, the best relationship is about compromise and sharing responsibilities. So, how can we turn a tug-of-war into a beautiful, responsive, animated tango? Enter, React hooks!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

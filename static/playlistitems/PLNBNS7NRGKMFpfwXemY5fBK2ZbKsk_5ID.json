        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/268458369/\n\n# Fast and robust visual unit tests for your React application\nby Dzianis Artsiukhovich\n\nDuring this talk, we’ll consider different techniques of UI testing.\nDiscuss the difference and pros/cons of various approaches of UI testing, such as plugins for e2e tests, visual testing with storybook, their challenges.\n\nAnd then discover how to implement such tests on unit/integration level, which means without server at all and based on SSR. You’ll see why and how we use visual unit tests at DAZN. Then you’ll learn how to implement such tests from scratch step by step based on small React application. We’ll also talk about the performance of such tests and about the integration into a pipeline.\n\nAbout Dzianis\n\nSenior Software Engineer and active open source contributor. From Minsk, but now based in London and work at DAZN. I like playing around with TS, React, Redux, MobX/MST, RxJS, WebGL, Serverless, Node, Functional Programming with a focus on performance, system architecture and team productivity.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/268458369/\n\n# Reacting to Tech Debt\nby Leonardo Garcia-Crespo\n\nTweetDeck is a complex application with a massive codebase that’s been around for more than 10 years. It started as an Adobe Air app, but the current codebase really started as a Chrome Web Store app. It once powered a windows app, and now it is a single-page app that is accessed in a browser but also as a Mac app. It went through countless refactors, tech stacks, feature additions, removals and modifications, and lots of bugfixes and workarounds for now old browsers.\n\nAs such, it accumulated technical debt and a lot of different coding paradigms. However, we managed to introduce React and successfully migrate several parts of the application, which allowed us to start moving faster again in those places. In this talk I want to show how we did that, some techniques and problems to solve when migrating an old codebase into React, and also learn to love what React gives us by looking at the problems we had before and how React removes them.\n\nAbout Leonardo (https://twitter.com/leogcrespo)\n\nSoftware Developer at Twitter.

Let’s explore together the refactoring of a real world app with hooks, introducing the concept and exploring how the mental model of components has to evolve breaking the dichotomy of stateful class vs stateless “functional” components.

Can we do that without vendor lock-in?\n\nEnter FABs, a portable, compact, immutable, server-side JS format that lets you deploy anything from static sites or Next.js to full custom server-rendered React apps anywhere that can run JS, like Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge, Now, etc. Come check it out!\n\nAbout Glen (https://twitter.com/glenmaddern)\n\nLocal business owner and cat enthusiast.

In this talk you will learn all you need to know about what a monorepo is, the benefits it provides, pitfalls to watch out for and how to make it work for you. We will examine how monorepos enable us to accelerate component library development. Along the way we look at some of the tooling involved such as Yarn Worspaces, Lerna, Rollup, npm and Storybook. You will lean about the concepts involved, trade-offs to consider and how monorepos can enable your dev team to deliver at scale.\n\nAbout Dmitri\n\nDmitri is a software dev at 11:FS Foundry where he is the building front end for a banking SaaS platform.

What about snapshot testing? What should be our code coverage? Those are questions we often hear when discussing testing. Those questions are easy to discuss but the answers won't necessarily make us write more reliable code. Many devs struggle to write tests 1) quickly and 2) that increase their degree of confidence.\n\nWriting good code that is easy to test requires a good understanding of programming principles and how they apply to the libraries of choice. Discussing principles is harder than discussing tools. In this talk, we'll discuss the principles that will make developers increase their test confidence when building React apps.\n\nAbout Alex\n\nFounder at React GraphQL Academy and LeanJS.

        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/260425694/\n\nThere are quite a few theoretical concepts of writing good a React application, including popular functional programming approaches. However, few take into consideration the impacts these will have on performance of the application. In this talk you’ll find out how some commonly used patterns have an adverse effect on the speed of your app, and how to avoid using them. We’ll mainly explore UI and state management but we’ll also dive into some native-specific issues and look at how to prevent them.\n\nAbout Anna\n\nAnna is a javascript developer who loves working with new technologies. Currently working at Hive, she does full-stack development to deliver a great end to end solution focused on user experience. She's a frequent speaker, runs workshops, and likes contributing to the community.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Then this talk is for you. TypeScript! Flow! ReasonML! Elm! All these beasts promise you the world, but we all know they come with work, effort, and risk. How do we optimise the benefits while minimising frustration? Learn to apply static types like a glamorous surgeon: inspecting our tools, identifying critical areas, and demonstrating how to apply our knowledge to get monumental returns for our skilful efforts.\n\nAbout Marcel\n\nMarcel is a vagabond software engineer whose work has ranged from providing software for satellites, to developing zombie based fitness apps for millions of users.

        "description": "Talk recording from opening React Advanced London event https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/254741173/\n\nFollow us for updates - https://twitter.com/reactadvanced\n\nIn this talk we'll dive into the approaches and strategies needed to create a great unit test environment for your JavaScript and React applications. We'll examine what makes the perfect test, what to avoid, and how to use more complex features like mocks and spies to enable you to write tests more easily. We'll also look at some of the common pitfalls and mistakes people make that can really begin to hurt you as your test suite grows.\n\nAbout Jack\n\nJack is a Frontend Engineer at Thread in London working primarily with React. In his free time, he’s usually writing or recording videos for his blog, JavaScript Playground. Jack is also the author of “Beginning jQuery” (Apress, 2012) and a regular speaker on React, Elm, JavaScript, build tools and frameworks.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Feb 2019 meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/258924199/\n\n## Native Web Apps: React and WebAssembly to Rewrite Native Apps\nby Florian Rival (https://twitter.com/florianrival)\n\nCan React and web technologies compete with native toolkits when it comes to making super complex, rich desktop apps? Can we go further and create better-than-native applications? 🤔 Sounds like a good challenge!\n\nThis talk introduces how React, JavaScript and WebAssembly can be used to write new ambitious apps, or port existing ones - with real world examples! Florian shows how to leverage the React ecosystem to create performant applications: architecture, patterns, typing, useful open-source modules and tooling... and how to go one step further and provide a better user experience as well as a better developer experience.\n\nThese apps are not web apps, they are not native apps, they are hybrid 'Native Web Apps' and can provide the best of both worlds.\n\nAbout Florian\n\nFlorian is a software engineer working at Facebook. He was an early adopter of React Native and open-sourced a few modules for it. He is the author of GDevelop, an open-source game making software based on React, WebAssembly, and JavaScript. He also made Lil BUB's Hello Earth, an 8-bit game starring the internet sensation cat, which available on desktop and mobile and powered by GDevelop and JavaScript.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

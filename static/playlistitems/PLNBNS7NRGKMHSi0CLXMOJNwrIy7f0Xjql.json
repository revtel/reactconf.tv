        "description": "Developers always can translate component to any other framework. We use pattern matching to see how we can transform specific part of code into same-behaving part in other frameworks. In this topic I will present idea of Universal Syntax Tree, when specific parts are declared as a pattern and each pattern has its own generator for any framework.\n\nAbout Vladimir\n\nVladimir is a software developer at Lightspeed HQ. When he writes react code, he's thinking not only about having a good component API and correct component-splitting, but also about optimization, on how React reconciler will process his component. He loves to make things perfect, even though no one is protected from having a bug!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Over the years companies and developers have invested a lot of time and money in development of UI components based on VanillaJS or various frameworks. Building components is time consuming, has integration and maintenance risks, and worst of all, distracts developers from the task at hand - actually building the application. In this presentation, you will learn how to quickly and easily “Reactify” your existing JavaScript components to use them in React applications.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Let Designers and Developers talk to each other\n# General Track\n\n“Should designers code?” or “Should coders design?”—these two eternal questions are being asked for years with no particular answer given.\n\n- How to let developers know what typography style or button variance they should be using on this particular screen?\n- How to ensure that the whole UI is consistent?\n- How to let designers know that some screen design doesn’t fit the requirements and needs to be updated?\n\nIn order to answer those questions designers and developers have to speak the same language. But what language should it be? UI components and pattern libraries can provide this intermediate abstraction and be a common language for both designers and developers.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Video recording from February 2019 meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Amsterdam/events/257858463/\n\nTesting is considered as standard practice in our industry. We use libraries to mock dependencies to test our code in isolation (e.g. services used in our React components). We take them for granted, assuming that they function correctly, probably by magic! Are mocking libraries “magic”?\n\nJoin Mattia to find out what libraries, such as Jest, are doing under the hood as you write your own mock testing library.\n\nAbout Mattia\nHe loves shell scripting; he literally lives in the terminal (that’s probably why he uses VIM). Other than getting his hands dirty with React, RxJS and Mobx, he is also passionate about cyber security and Motorbikes.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Summit Remote Edition 2020\n\nWebsite - https://remote.reactsummit.com/\n\n\nSee other React conferences by GitNation\nReact Summit – https://reactsummit.com\nReact Advanced London – https://reactadvanced.com\nReact Day Berlin – https://reactday.berlin/\n\n\n#Bringing Ionic (and Web Components) to React\nIonic is a framework for building fast and powerful mobile, desktop, and web apps with web technology. Traditionally, Ionic has been built on top of one framework: Angular. But recently, Ionic added support for React, and aims to bring the same great development experience to the React ecosystem. In this talk, we’ll look at how an Ionic React app works and how this changes the React ecosystem (surprise, it's because of Web Components).\n\n\nMike Hartington\nMike is a developer, Google Developer Expert, and Ionic Developer Advocate who’s been working in the mobile landscape for most of his professional career. When he’s not working Ionic itself, Mike speaks frequently about mobile development and Progressive Web Apps. In his spare time, he’s an aspiring woodworker, occasional musician, and craft beer lover.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

However, while Lighthouse reports issues related to images, scripts, and more, it doesn't really address video performance. That means streaming can suffer for end users, resulting in buffering and slow starts, while businesses incur huge data transfer costs due to unoptimized delivery.\n\nIn this lightning talk, we'll explore some quick wins every developer should know: optimizing video size and format, optimizing streaming for every device and network, and different video loading strategies to improve performance. In just seven minutes, you'll leave with a toolkit to make your videos load faster, play smoother, and feel as polished as the rest of your app, closing a significant gap that performance audits often overlook.\n\nWatch the full talk in 1080p on GitNation website: https://gitnation.com/contents/video-optimization-for-the-web-the-missing-piece-in-lighthouse\n\nFollow the link to watch the full version of all the conference talks, QnA’s with speakers and hands-on workshop recordings → https://gitnation.com/events/react-summit-us-2025\n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:00 Video Optimization Principles\n01:44 Optimizing Video Loading and User Interactions\n\n🔥 Want to hear talks like this live?

        "description": "Talk: Oli Legat - \"Why Writing a Pinch-to-Zoom Component Is Harder Than You Think\", React Summit US 2025\n\nAt first glance, building a pinch-to-zoom and pan component in React seems simple. After all, the browser’s gesture events are already there. But when you need realistic, design-friendly motion and the ability to zoom axes independently, the problem gets much trickier. In this talk, I’ll share how we approached this challenge in our AG Charts React component: from the pitfalls of naïve implementations, to the realisation that pan and zoom are mathematically identical problems. You’ll see how some pen & paper algebra unlocked a precise and intuitive gesture system where X and Y scales update independently—kept in sync with React state—delivering smooth interactions beyond what you get in maps or images.\n\nWatch the full talk with Q&A on GitNation website: https://gitnation.com/contents/why-writing-a-pinch-to-zoom-component-is-harder-than-you-think\n\nFollow the link to watch the full version of all the conference talks, QnA’s with speakers and hands-on workshop recordings → https://gitnation.com/events/react-summit-us-2025\n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:00 Pinch-to-Zoom Component Challenge\n01:23 Independent X and Y-axis Control\n03:41 Unified Touch Interactions\n06:10 Interpolated Touch Coordinates\n08:56 Equation Implementation and Event Handling\n10:28 React Integration and CSS Transform\n11:58 Component Integration and Math Solver\n13:51 CSS Transformation Calculation\n14:42 Normalized Coordinate Space and Scale Calculation\n15:37 Realistic Touch Gestures and Caveats\n17:16 Pinch-to-Zoom Implementation Features\n\n🔥 Want to hear talks like this live?

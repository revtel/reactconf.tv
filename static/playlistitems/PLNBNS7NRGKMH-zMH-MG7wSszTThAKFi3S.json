When this JavaScript is parsed, CSS is generated and attached into the DOM. It allows you to abstract CSS to the component level itself, using JavaScript to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way.\n\nMax Stoiber\nMax is the technical cofounder of Spectrum.chat, the community platform of the future. He also makes styled-components, react-boilerplate, micro-analytics and a bunch of other open source projects and he co-organises the ReactVienna meetup. He loves to travel, to brew rad coffee and to ski beautiful mountains.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You write stories every day. You build narratives, characters and plots — but you aren’t writing a novel, you’re writing components. I came to engineering from the world of creative writing and what surprised me the most is how similar code is to fiction. React itself follows tenants of creative writing and when you lean into those rules, you create solid component architecture. In this talk you’ll learn how to write React like its fiction and what you can gain by doing so.\n\nJenn Creighton\nJenn Creighton is a frontend engineer and conference speaker.

What about snapshot testing? What should be our code coverage? Those are questions we often hear when discussing testing. Those questions are easy to discuss but the answers won’t necessarily make us write more reliable and flexible code. Many developers struggle to write tests 1) quickly and 2) that increase their degree of confidence. Writing good tests requires writing good code. Writing good code that is easy to test requires a good understanding of programming principles and how they apply to the libraries of choice. Discussing principles is harder than discussing tools. In this talk, we’ll discuss the principles that will make developers increase their test confidence when building React apps. I’ll also use those principles to challenge some believes that the audience might have about certain testing libraries or methodologies.\n\nAlex Lobera\nFounder at React GraphQL Academy and LeanJS.

At Twilio we’ve been building REST APIs for over 10 years. When we recently decided to ship Twilio Flex, a software that has a working UI out of the box, we still wanted to make sure that it was as flexible as the rest of our APIs.\n\nIn this talk we’ll dive into how we architected a programmable UI platform using React that both allows you to have a fully working UI out of the box but also be able to customize every functionality and user experience to your needs using the full power of React.\n\nNarendra Shetty\nNarendra works at Twilio as Senior Software Engineer. He is working on building Twilio Flex which is a programmable UI product. Previously worked at Booking.com.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

It provides developers with concrete, solid guarantees at the API layer, preventing surprises when interacting with client-server applications. REST has been often criticized as weaker in this regard, since it is not a formal specification. This talk explores working with similar (if not better) contractually-sound REST APIs in a React application using powerful new tooling.\n\nTejas Kumar\nTejas enjoys people, code, and talking about code to people. Having begun coding at age 8, today Tejas travels around the world, encouraging, educating and empowering developers in the web development community.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Nothing in React prevents us from building accessible web apps, but we need to learn to harness its power in the right way while dealing with some unique challenges caused by creating web pages with JavaScript. This talk will focus on these issues and how to solve them in the real world, while also adding some a11y power to your development process. This talk will also focus on why it is important to build accessible web apps.\n\nManjula Dube\nManjula loves contributing to OSS in her free time. She loves teaching and believes it is best way to learn more and more. She is one of the organisers for React India.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Day Berlin Conference 2019\n  \nCheck out the latest React Day Berlin news – https://reactday.berlin\n\nSee other React conferences by GitNation\nReact Summit Amsterdam – https://reactsummit.com\nReact Advanced London – https://reactadvanced.com\n\n# Parallel computing in ReactJS\nUser is working with your application, suddenly, UI freezes and probably, one of the CPU cores is burning! They cannot do anything. The only perception you can feel is as hot as a hell metal case of the laptop. Although this sounds like a horror movie, this is your application that cannot leverage modern APIs to lift heavy computation to a different thread where consequently user suffers the pain.\n\nModern features like Web Workers, WebAssembly, Worklets, and Service Worker allow us to leverage multithreading computing to run tasks parallelly which at the end, makes the user feel like in a rainbow paradise instead of a nightmare, even though JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language!\n\nIn this session, Majid shows his experience running jobs in parallel on a React.js application that will provide a pleasant user experience and exciting development.\n\nMajid Hajian\nMajid Hajian is a passionate software developer with years of developing and architecting complex web and mobile applications. He is passionate about web platform especially flutter, IoT, PWAs, and performance. He loves sharing his knowledge with the community by writing and speaking, contributing to open source and organizing meetups and events.\nMajid is the author of \"Progressive web app with Angular\" book by Apress and \"Progressive Web Apps\" video course by PacktPub and Udemy. He is (co)organizer of a few mobile and web meetups in Norway as well as Nordic conferences for mobile and Angular, Mobile Era and ngVikings.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

(feat. Ink)\nText-based CLI tools are great. They are fast, lightweight, and universally accessible. But what does CLI have to do with React?\n\nIn this lightning talk, we will have a look at Ink - a wonderful custom React renderer that allows us to use Flexbox to create excellent command-line interfaces with ease. Want to create a companion CLI tool for the next big thing that you are working on?

React has a functional nature, however, TypeScript has not. It lacks some popular patterns and data structures we use and love in other functional languages like ReasonML, Elm, or PureScript. Fortunately, for the rescue, there is a rising library called fp-ts. Let me show you how it can help you.\n\nRobin Pokorny\nRobin is a JavaScript developer at NewStore, creating a mobile retail platform in React. Enjoys writing functional JavaScript, explores Reason for inspiration.

Having a typing system in place is beneficial in many cases - from refactoring old code to onboarding new team members. However, in the attempts to increase coverage it is easy to shoot yourself in the foot and end up with a system that is not helpful enough or even slows down development time. Let’s figure out together, how spending the same amount of time on this task can lead to a more resilient and effective type system in your React projects.\n\nOlena Sovyn\nSenior Software Engineer at Webflow. I like React, flow, Redux, and healthy functional programming. Secret fun of CSS and Avengers.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Developers teams move this design system into code using the React component approach.\n\nBut there is a problem. The final version of the product does not exist. As there is no final iPhone.\nProduct teams work daily on product. But design layouts and components in the code live in different worlds, they need to be updated manually.\n\nHow to continuously deliver design changes to the react design system?\n\nFigma is a new design tool that is gaining popularity. Unlike Sketch, Figma works on the web, the native environment of component design systems. It has an API. Sasha (designer) and Zar (developer) show how to synchronize design systems from two worlds.\n\nZar Zakharov\nZar is not a designer, but he knows everything about design-systems. In frontend development for over 13 years.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

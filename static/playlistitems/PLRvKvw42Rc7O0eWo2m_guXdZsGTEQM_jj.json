        "description": "Recorded live at Reactathon 2022. Learn more at https://reactathon.com\n\nAdvanced Rendering Patterns\nAs modern applications are getting more and more complex, it's quite easy to end up with large bundle sizes and long loading times. Although there are many tools that can help with performance, there's still a lot you can do as a developer to load your code more efficiently. Fortunately, with the help of modern rendering patterns, we can reduce complexity, bundle sizes, and reduce loading times. In this talk, you'll learn about the implementation and use cases of modern rendering patterns including SSR, (on-demand) ISR, Streaming SSR, React Server Components, Progressive Rehydration, and Selective Rehydration.\n\nAbout Lydia Hallie\nLydia Hallie is a Staff Developer Advocate at Vercel primarily focusing on web performance, React, Node, GraphQL, and serverless technologies. She also spends her time mentoring and doing in-person training sessions.\n\nEvent production and post-production by EventLoop.

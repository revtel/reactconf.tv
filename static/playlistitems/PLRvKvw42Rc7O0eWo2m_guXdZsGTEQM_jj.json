Over the years, the pendulum has swung from servers rendering HTML to JavaScript-heavy clients and now it's swinging toward something more in the middle.What about the web today is enabling us to overcome the shortcomings of the web of the past? In this talk, we'll get a little peak into the history of each of these stages of the web and what that means for anyone building on the web platform in the future.\n\nAbout Kent C. Dodds\nKent C.

Learn more at https://reactathon.com\n\nAdvanced Rendering Patterns\nAs modern applications are getting more and more complex, it's quite easy to end up with large bundle sizes and long loading times. Although there are many tools that can help with performance, there's still a lot you can do as a developer to load your code more efficiently. Fortunately, with the help of modern rendering patterns, we can reduce complexity, bundle sizes, and reduce loading times. In this talk, you'll learn about the implementation and use cases of modern rendering patterns including SSR, (on-demand) ISR, Streaming SSR, React Server Components, Progressive Rehydration, and Selective Rehydration.\n\nAbout Lydia Hallie\nLydia Hallie is a Staff Developer Advocate at Vercel primarily focusing on web performance, React, Node, GraphQL, and serverless technologies.

Learn more at https://reactathon.com\n\nGoodbye, useEffect\nFrom fetching data to fighting with imperative APIs, side effects are one of the biggest sources of frustration in web app development. And let’s be honest, putting everything in useEffect hooks doesn’t help much. Thankfully, there is a science (well, math) to side effects, formalized in state machines and statecharts, that can help us visually model and understand how to declaratively orchestrate effects, no matter how complex they get. In this talk, we’ll ditch the useEffect hook and discover how these computer science principles can be used to simplify effects in our React apps.\n\nAboud David Khourshid\nDavid is a software engineer who loves playing piano and is passionate about animations, state machines, cutting-edge user interfaces, and open-source. Previously at Microsoft, he is now the founder of Stately, a startup focused on making even the most complex application logic visual and accessible to developers and non-developers alike.\n\nEvent production and post-production by EventLoop.

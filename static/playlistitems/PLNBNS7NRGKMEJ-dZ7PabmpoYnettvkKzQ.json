React is built primarily for the browser, while Node has fundamentally different operational constraints to the browser. While working as a Principal Architect and Consultant, it has become painfully clear to David that React’s Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a performance bottleneck for web backends around the world. This talk demonstrates a very simple solution that can be dropped into pre-existing React applications to vastly improve the throughput of an SSR Node server (around 20-40x+).\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/260425694/\n\nThere are quite a few theoretical concepts of writing good a React application, including popular functional programming approaches. However, few take into consideration the impacts these will have on performance of the application. In this talk you’ll find out how some commonly used patterns have an adverse effect on the speed of your app, and how to avoid using them. We’ll mainly explore UI and state management but we’ll also dive into some native-specific issues and look at how to prevent them.\n\nAbout Anna\n\nAnna is a javascript developer who loves working with new technologies. Currently working at Hive, she does full-stack development to deliver a great end to end solution focused on user experience. She's a frequent speaker, runs workshops, and likes contributing to the community.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

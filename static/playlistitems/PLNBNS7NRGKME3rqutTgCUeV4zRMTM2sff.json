        "title": "Designing with React.js: How should our design processes change? - Mark Dalgleish",
        "description": "Talk recording from React Amsterdam 2019 Conference  \n\nCheck out the latest React Summit Amsterdam news – https://reactsummit.com\n\nSee other React conferences by GitNation\nReact Day Berlin – https://reactday.berlin\nReact Advanced London – https://reactadvanced.com\n\n# Designing with React\n# General Track\n\nThanks to React's component-oriented architecture, the React community has been naturally gravitating towards design systems as a way of standardising our respective design languages into reusable components. When done successfully, it suddenly becomes trivial to translate standard designs into code. In fact, we may even find that this translation step starts to feel somewhat redundant. In a world of components, how should our design processes change? How should our tooling change? How should we, as React developers, better enable this change? In this talk, you'll see the current state of design and development, and where we could go—if we're willing to push for it.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Let Designers and Developers talk to each other\n# General Track\n\n“Should designers code?” or “Should coders design?”—these two eternal questions are being asked for years with no particular answer given.\n\n- How to let developers know what typography style or button variance they should be using on this particular screen?\n- How to ensure that the whole UI is consistent?\n- How to let designers know that some screen design doesn’t fit the requirements and needs to be updated?\n\nIn order to answer those questions designers and developers have to speak the same language. But what language should it be? UI components and pattern libraries can provide this intermediate abstraction and be a common language for both designers and developers.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Developers teams move this design system into code using the React component approach.\n\nBut there is a problem. The final version of the product does not exist. As there is no final iPhone.\nProduct teams work daily on product. But design layouts and components in the code live in different worlds, they need to be updated manually.\n\nHow to continuously deliver design changes to the react design system?\n\nFigma is a new design tool that is gaining popularity. Unlike Sketch, Figma works on the web, the native environment of component design systems. It has an API. Sasha (designer) and Zar (developer) show how to synchronize design systems from two worlds.\n\nZar Zakharov\nZar is not a designer, but he knows everything about design-systems. In frontend development for over 13 years.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In this talk, I'm exploring this concept and showing my daily workflow that can probably help to bridge the gap between devs and designers.\n\nElizabet Oliveira\nElizabet is a designer who likes to code. As a ReactJS enthusiast, she built and maintains React-Kawaii. A React library of fun kawaii characters that won \"Fun Side Project of the Year\" in React Amsterdam Open Source Awards 2018. Besides that, her passion for music and past experience as the first female rapper in Portugal under a major deal, led her to start Cassette Tape. The HTML5 based looper and recorder has granted her a spot in Google I/0 Dublin, in 2016. Also, a big fan of open-source, she has recently released a song for the designer/dev community called \"Fork This\" (2020).\nElizabet currently works as Senior Product Designer for Elastic. Her mission is to bridge the gap between front-end and design.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/#",

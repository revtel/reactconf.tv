What is the case for it? A bit of history?\n* A quick glimpse at the “Testing Library” concept itself\n* Why it has been created? What is this all about?\n* “React Native Testing Library” is under Callstack and separate from the ecosystem – what is the story behind that?\n* What kind of technical differences is between RNTL and the ecosystem? And why so many?\n* The current state of the library\n* What is the future of the React Native Testing Library?\n\n#reactnative #callstack\n\nLearn more about React Native testing from our blog:\n1.

Well, React Native Paper definitely is!\n\nThis time, our host Mike Grabowski and his guest, Dawid Urbaniak, the lead engineer on React Native Paper, are talking about this popular UI library. \n\nHere is the agenda for this episode:\nIntroduction part:\n- introduction to React Native Paper\n- key features of React Native Paper \n- how is React Native Paper different from the other libraries such as Native Base or React Native Elements \n\nA dive into React Native Paper:\n- How did the React Native Paper team approach animations to make them truly native-looking?\n- What opportunities do you think Turbo Modules and Fabric will bring in terms of performance? Are they likely to make animations even smoother?\n- What are the details of the major upgrade to the library that include support for Material Design 2.0?\n- Designers often make their slight adjustments and create whole new components when working with Material Design. Is Paper an “all or nothing” UI library or can you easily adjust it and extend it to your own designs?\n- Can designers use some parts of Paper to create their own UI library?\n- What makes the React Native Paper so unique and popular?\n- Plans for the future of React Native Paper. \n\nSit back, relax and enjoy The React Native Show!\n\nDon’t forget to push the Subscribe button and share this video on your social media.

The changes include:\n\n- Turbo Modules - the new implementation of native modules created for better performance and synchronous access,\n- CodeGen - to ease the creation of native modules by synchronizing the typed definitions,\n- JSI - JavaScript Interface,\n- Fabric - UI re-architecture.\n\nIn this part of The React Native Show podcast, our host, Mike Grabowski, and his guests:\n\nMonica Restrepo – Software Engineer at Major League Soccer\nKudo Chien – Software Engineer at CloudMosa\nEloy Duran – Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft\nRam N – an Engineering Manager at Oculus\n\ndiscuss the details of the upcoming re-architecture of React Native.\n\nIn this video you’ll hear about:\n- What is the status of the re-architecture? What changes are already shipped and when do we expect to have an update on the rest of them?\n- Where can we track the updates on the re-architecture?\n- Can we expect a smooth transition path between the current and, let’s say, the “new” React Native?\n- One of the latest and greatest features that are currently running on Android in production is Hermes – a JS engine. What are the biggest differences from the V8 JavaScript engine and why was there a decision to essentially write something from the ground up?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M",

Do you think it could – potentially – be an interesting achievement for the Flutter community that would make React Native a viable choice for them?\n- How does Microsoft plan to implement the features from the re-architecture, such as CodeGen, when they land?

What were the takeaways from the solution?\n- React Native is being widely used by companies that already have a native mobile application to share certain pieces of the UI across platforms or to eventually migrate to it, by replacing screen after screen on a production application. What kind of challenges do you see in that area these days and what would you advise someone who is looking into migrating a native application?\n- What is your typical workflow when working on a new app? Do you rather build something your own using low-level primitives or you pull in community libraries, such as react-native-paper?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M",

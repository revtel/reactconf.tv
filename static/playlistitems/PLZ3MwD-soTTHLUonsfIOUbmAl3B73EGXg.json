        "description": "Episode 1 - Look into the future of React Native Testing Library with Michał Pierzchała\n\nIn the first episode of our podcast, Mike \"grabbou\" Grabowski(the host) is talking about React Native Testing Library with his guest - Michał Pierzchała (@thymikee) who is the owner of the library.\n\nDuring the conversation, they cover such topics as:\n\n* Introduction to the React Native Testing Library\nhttps://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/\n* What is it? What is the case for it? A bit of history?\n* A quick glimpse at the “Testing Library” concept itself\n* Why it has been created? What is this all about?\n* “React Native Testing Library” is under Callstack and separate from the ecosystem – what is the story behind that?\n* What kind of technical differences is between RNTL and the ecosystem? And why so many?\n* The current state of the library\n* What is the future of the React Native Testing Library?\n\nLearn more about React Native testing from our blog:\n1.

Well, React Native Paper definitely is!\n\nThis time, our host Mike Grabowski and his guest, Dawid Urbaniak, the lead engineer on React Native Paper, are talking about this popular UI library. \n\nHere is the agenda for this episode:\nIntroduction part:\n- introduction to React Native Paper\n- key features of React Native Paper \n- how is React Native Paper different from the other libraries such as Native Base or React Native Elements \n\nA dive into React Native Paper:\n- How did the React Native Paper team approach animations to make them truly native-looking?\n- What opportunities do you think Turbo Modules and Fabric will bring in terms of performance? Are they likely to make animations even smoother?\n- What are the details of the major upgrade to the library that include support for Material Design 2.0?\n- Designers often make their slight adjustments and create whole new components when working with Material Design. Is Paper an “all or nothing” UI library or can you easily adjust it and extend it to your own designs?\n- Can designers use some parts of Paper to create their own UI library?\n- What makes the React Native Paper so unique and popular?\n- Plans for the future of React Native Paper. \n\nSit back, relax and enjoy The React Native Show!\n\nDon’t forget to push the Subscribe button and share this video on your social media. More episodes are coming soon!\n\nRead more about React Native Paper:\n\n1.

        "description": "The React Native team announced a lot of changes to the core of React Native that address a lot of challenges that developers were facing when building apps. The changes include:\n\n- Turbo Modules - the new implementation of native modules created for better performance and synchronous access,\n- CodeGen - to ease the creation of native modules by synchronizing the typed definitions,\n- JSI - JavaScript Interface,\n- Fabric - UI re-architecture.\n\nIn this part of The React Native Show podcast, our host, Mike Grabowski, and his guests:\n\nMonica Restrepo – Software Engineer at Major League Soccer\nKudo Chien – Software Engineer at CloudMosa\nEloy Duran – Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft\nRam N – an Engineering Manager at Oculus\n\ndiscuss the details of the upcoming re-architecture of React Native.\n\nIn this video you’ll hear about:\n- What is the status of the re-architecture? What changes are already shipped and when do we expect to have an update on the rest of them?\n- Where can we track the updates on the re-architecture?\n- Can we expect a smooth transition path between the current and, let’s say, the “new” React Native?\n- One of the latest and greatest features that are currently running on Android in production is Hermes – a JS engine. What are the biggest differences from the V8 JavaScript engine and why was there a decision to essentially write something from the ground up?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M\n\nRead more about React Native EU 2020 Virtual Conference:\n\n1.React Native EU 2020 Virtual Edition – Summary\nhttps://callstack.com/blog/react-native-eu-2020-virtual-edition-summary/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=rneu_q_%26_a_podcast_short\n\n2.

Do you think it could – potentially – be an interesting achievement for the Flutter community that would make React Native a viable choice for them?\n- How does Microsoft plan to implement the features from the re-architecture, such as CodeGen, when they land? Is this something you’re already thinking about?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M\n\nRead more about React Native EU 2020 Virtual Conference:\n\n1.React Native EU 2020 Virtual Edition – Summary\nhttps://callstack.com/blog/react-native-eu-2020-virtual-edition-summary/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=rneu_q_%26_a_podcast_short\n\n2.

What were the takeaways from the solution?\n- React Native is being widely used by companies that already have a native mobile application to share certain pieces of the UI across platforms or to eventually migrate to it, by replacing screen after screen on a production application. What kind of challenges do you see in that area these days and what would you advise someone who is looking into migrating a native application?\n- What is your typical workflow when working on a new app? Do you rather build something your own using low-level primitives or you pull in community libraries, such as react-native-paper?\n\nThis video is a part of The React Native Show Podcast Ep 2: \"React Native EU 2020 Conference Q&A Panel\" \nWatch the full episode here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHSe66Dhs7M\n\nRead more about React Native EU 2020 Virtual Conference:\n\n1.React Native EU 2020 Virtual Edition – Summary\nhttps://callstack.com/blog/react-native-eu-2020-virtual-edition-summary/?utm_campaign=React_Native_EU&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_content=rneu_q_%26_a_podcast_short\n\n2.

        "description": "In this episode of The React Native Show podcast our host, Mike Grabowski, and his guests: \n- Eloy Durán, a Software Engineer at Microsoft (https://twitter.com/alloy)\n- and Xuan Huang, a Software Engineer at Facebook (https://twitter.com/Huxpro)\n\nIt’s a great opportunity to know the details of this major update to React Native 0.64 because Mike, Eloy and Xuan worked together on bringing Hermes to iOS!\n\nIn the first part of the podcast, our experts focus on the following topics:\n- Hermes improvements to React Native apps in terms of three metrics: Time To Interactive (TTI), Application Size (APK), Memory consumption\n- The “magic” behind Hermes - “Bytecode Precompilation” a.k.a. AOT\n- The difference between AOT and JIT\n- JIT JS engine pipeline vs Hermes pipeline\n- The Hermes roadmap and plans for further improvements\n\nLater on, Mike and his guests talk about the story behind bringing Hermes to React Native MacOS and take a quick look into the future of this major update.\n\nIn this part, they cover the following topics:\n- What was the motivation behind adding support for Hermes on MacOS? Any plans for RN Windows?\n- Were there any attempts to bring Chakra to run on macOS, to say, provide more unified experience across desktop platforms?\n- On Apple devices, unlike Android ones, there was always less of performance and memory related issues when it comes to running React Native applications. What would be the selling point of Hermes in such a case?\n\nThis and much more awaits you in the Episode #5 of The React Native Show!\n\nDon’t forget to push the Subscribe button and share this video on your social media.

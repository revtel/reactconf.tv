What is the case for it? A bit of history?\n* A quick glimpse at the “Testing Library” concept itself\n* Why it has been created? What is this all about?\n* “React Native Testing Library” is under Callstack and separate from the ecosystem – what is the story behind that?\n* What kind of technical differences is between RNTL and the ecosystem? And why so many?\n* The current state of the library\n* What is the future of the React Native Testing Library?\n\n#reactnative #callstack\n\nLearn more about React Native testing from our blog:\n1.

Well, React Native Paper definitely is!\n\nThis time, our host Mike Grabowski and his guest, Dawid Urbaniak, the lead engineer on React Native Paper, are talking about this popular UI library. \n\nHere is the agenda for this episode:\nIntroduction part:\n- introduction to React Native Paper\n- key features of React Native Paper \n- how is React Native Paper different from the other libraries such as Native Base or React Native Elements \n\nA dive into React Native Paper:\n- How did the React Native Paper team approach animations to make them truly native-looking?\n- What opportunities do you think Turbo Modules and Fabric will bring in terms of performance? Are they likely to make animations even smoother?\n- What are the details of the major upgrade to the library that include support for Material Design 2.0?\n- Designers often make their slight adjustments and create whole new components when working with Material Design. Is Paper an “all or nothing” UI library or can you easily adjust it and extend it to your own designs?\n- Can designers use some parts of Paper to create their own UI library?\n- What makes the React Native Paper so unique and popular?\n- Plans for the future of React Native Paper. \n\nSit back, relax and enjoy The React Native Show!\n\nDon’t forget to push the Subscribe button and share this video on your social media.

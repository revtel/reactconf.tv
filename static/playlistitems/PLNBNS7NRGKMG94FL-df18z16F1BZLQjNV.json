This is great because one tech team can build both your web app and native mobile experience. The problem is developers hate writing things twice. There have been a couple of efforts to build a unifying technology to write an application once and have it work on both web and native. Yet this is not always the best approach. There is value in only sharing your business and state logic; keeping your render code separate.\n\nIn this talk, Ben Elerby gives real examples from his work with MADE.COM, migrating their web and mobile application to React and React-Native with code sharing as a primary objective.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You announce the conference, start planning the venue, getting sponsors, & fielding talks. Things start getting serious, & before you know it you’re overloaded with obligations. Oh, & you forgot: You also need a conference app!\n\nYou don’t just want any conference app; you want it to be fun, engaging, & a valuable addition to the attendees. How can you do this in the least amount of time?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show how you can rapidly prototype, build, & deploy your app using GraphQL, React Native, & AWS AppSync so you can spend your time worrying about more important things in life. In addition to what you’d expect from a conference app, we’ll be adding live chat so attendees discuss talks & speakers can field questions & interact with them in real-time.\"\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/260425694/\n\nThere are quite a few theoretical concepts of writing good a React application, including popular functional programming approaches. However, few take into consideration the impacts these will have on performance of the application. In this talk you’ll find out how some commonly used patterns have an adverse effect on the speed of your app, and how to avoid using them. We’ll mainly explore UI and state management but we’ll also dive into some native-specific issues and look at how to prevent them.\n\nAbout Anna\n\nAnna is a javascript developer who loves working with new technologies. Currently working at Hive, she does full-stack development to deliver a great end to end solution focused on user experience. She's a frequent speaker, runs workshops, and likes contributing to the community.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions. In this talk you will learn how to do that and see a real-world example.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

During this time, we’ve observed more progression than ever before towards the vision of a cross-platform mobile solution. Even still, we have yet to realise its core mission of being as powerful as pure native. There have been many challenges that we’ve faced head on as they’ve surfaced. In overcoming them with the support of the community, we’ve managed to establish React Native as a force that is now defining the future of the segment.\n\nExplore this history-in-the-making before diving deeper into more technical subjects including the JSI & JSC upgrade, TurboModules & Fabric, and the CodeGen. With all the pieces of the puzzle in place and landing on master by end of the year, we are closer to reaching our original objective than ever before - while pushing the limits to a whole new level.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Adam's team could have pursued a typical release strategy—instead, they got creative with React Native.\n\nThey built a strangler-style architecture, a technique commonly reserved for web services, to release our greenfield React Native product user-by-user. The effect was some pretty unique and awesome advantages to how we built and tested our new app—but software is never perfect.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Take a look at the internals of React Native, and how code written in JavaScript can power a fully native mobile application. See the various parts of the current system like the bridge, the UI manager and the plugins. The talks also touches upon the rendering process and compare it to React’s rendering on the web.\n\nSee some of the new and exciting improvements (like Fabric, TurboModules and JSI) and how they significantly improve React Native. This talk stems from Parashuram's experiences as a web-developer newbie on the React Native team, and is an attempt to document his journey in comprehending the code base. At the end of the talk, the attendees will not only be able to build React Native apps, but also understands how it all works together.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Scaling this project requires code architecture that enables each module to be developed separately, but easily fit the big puzzle.\nWe’ll discuss the way we do both unit and E2E testing, the way we scale our CI, the way we deploy and how we fix issues in production when they arise.\nWe’ll also share our plans to how we’re going to scale our app and dev process to support 100 developers a year from today.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Most users will not return to an app after installing it, and that is where push notifications come into play. In my talk I'll be talking about how to achieve this feature with React Native for both iOS and Android.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

A few of these can be aggregated into a \"networking\" layer that manages the transfer of data. This layer was designed to mimic an API we have in the Web, but despite all the similarities, it has its own *qualities* and caveats every good React Native developer should know about. In this talk I'll try to guide you through the networking layer in React Native and share some tips and tricks I've learned along the way.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

The main hurdle for web developers coming to mobile development (native apps with React native or PWAs) is handling offline capabilities.\n\nJosh speaks firsthand about this learning curve, the pitfalls and realisations of doing this in production apps. As an architect developer at Theodo, he has seen developers struggle with this mindset switch on their projects over the past 2 years, and wants to share their learnings!\n\nJosh speaks about:\n- Optimistic UX updating\n- Data persistence between app/server\n- Offline mode (request queuing)\n- Reconciling updates after this\"\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You announce the conference, start planning the venue, getting sponsors, & fielding talks. Things start getting serious, & before you know it you’re overloaded with obligations. Oh, & you forgot: You also need a conference app!\n\nYou don’t just want any conference app; you want it to be fun, engaging, & a valuable addition to the attendees. How can you do this in the least amount of time?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show how you can rapidly prototype, build, & deploy your app using GraphQL, React Native, & AWS AppSync so you can spend your time worrying about more important things in life. In addition to what you’d expect from a conference app, we’ll be adding live chat so attendees discuss talks & speakers can field questions & interact with them in real-time.\"\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/260425694/\n\nThere are quite a few theoretical concepts of writing good a React application, including popular functional programming approaches. However, few take into consideration the impacts these will have on performance of the application. In this talk you’ll find out how some commonly used patterns have an adverse effect on the speed of your app, and how to avoid using them. We’ll mainly explore UI and state management but we’ll also dive into some native-specific issues and look at how to prevent them.\n\nAbout Anna\n\nAnna is a javascript developer who loves working with new technologies. Currently working at Hive, she does full-stack development to deliver a great end to end solution focused on user experience. She's a frequent speaker, runs workshops, and likes contributing to the community.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions. In this talk you will learn how to do that and see a real-world example.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

During this time, we’ve observed more progression than ever before towards the vision of a cross-platform mobile solution. Even still, we have yet to realise its core mission of being as powerful as pure native. There have been many challenges that we’ve faced head on as they’ve surfaced. In overcoming them with the support of the community, we’ve managed to establish React Native as a force that is now defining the future of the segment.\n\nExplore this history-in-the-making before diving deeper into more technical subjects including the JSI & JSC upgrade, TurboModules & Fabric, and the CodeGen. With all the pieces of the puzzle in place and landing on master by end of the year, we are closer to reaching our original objective than ever before - while pushing the limits to a whole new level.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

This is great because one tech team can build both your web app and native mobile experience. The problem is developers hate writing things twice. There have been a couple of efforts to build a unifying technology to write an application once and have it work on both web and native. Yet this is not always the best approach. There is value in only sharing your business and state logic; keeping your render code separate.\n\nIn this talk, Ben Elerby gives real examples from his work with MADE.COM, migrating their web and mobile application to React and React-Native with code sharing as a primary objective.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Can we go further and create better-than-native applications? 🤔 Sounds like a good challenge!\n\nThis talk introduces how React, JavaScript and WebAssembly can be used to write new ambitious apps, or port existing ones - with real world examples! Florian shows how to leverage the React ecosystem to create performant applications: architecture, patterns, typing, useful open-source modules and tooling... and how to go one step further and provide a better user experience as well as a better developer experience.\n\nThese apps are not web apps, they are not native apps, they are hybrid 'Native Web Apps' and can provide the best of both worlds.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

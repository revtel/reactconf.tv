In this talk, I’ll use visualizations to show you how the JavaScript engine handles our human-friendly code, and compiles it to code that machines understand.",

This talk will cover how Flexport uses static analysis to gain insight on how internal components and APIs are being used, the decisions and insights these metrics can drive, and how you can implement these metrics on your own React code base. By the end of this talk, you will learn how you can write your own custom abstract syntax tree (AST) parsers to gain insight into your own React codebase, and learn about the successes we've had at Flexport using this system.",

        "title": "Jen Luker - Accessibility: Beyond the Basics",
        "description": "Accessibility in React has been a hot topic in the last few years, but in this talk, we'll be going beyond the basics. We'll explore a data-driven perspective to convince the business to invest in accessibility, then dive into the details of accessibility testing. We'll use lighthouse to audit applications, educate ourselves with the axe browser extensions, incorporate eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y into our lint process, and add axe-core to our automated testing suite. You'll leave prepared to add accessibility features to your application.\n\nJen Luker is a Lead software engineer at Formidable, a BookBytes podcast co-host, and a member of the RxJS learning team. She has spent a majority of her decade-long career as a full-stack developer using PHP, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular fondness for front end technologies. Jen trains others in ReactJS and accessibility, loves optimizing webpack builds, and codes apps in React Native. When she's not finding solutions, learning new technologies, or reading, her spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting; she's even been known to 3D print her own tools for the job. Jen is also fascinated by all things space, enjoys vintage cars, and is always looking for good conversation.\n\nFilmed at Reactathon September 2018 at GitHub in San Francisco, CA. \n\nOrganized by Real World React.

        "description": "Your app is bigger and slower than it needs to be. Without rewriting app code we can squeeze more performance out of your code by tweaking Webpack and Babel. These tools are immensely powerful but it’s a delicate dance to get them to play nice. This talk is full of tips and tricks to get you there. After three years of tooling around with Webpack and Babel at Netflix, LinkedIn, and Reddit Brian got some battle-won knowledge that he’d like to share with you all. Some non-intuitive tricks that lead to smaller bundles, faster parse times, browser-engine opts and de-opts, and faster perceived load times. While these examples will use react to make examples this apply to any application that uses these two phenomenal tools. You’ll be surprised at what you can do just turning a few knobs.\n\nBrian Holt is a senior cloud developer advocate at Microsoft, where he’s all about developers, developers, developers. Previously, he was a JavaScript engineer at Netflix, LinkedIn, and Reddit. When not working, Brian finds time to teach on Frontend Masters, run his mouth on Front End Happy Hour, travel all over the world, and play with his adorable dog.\n\nFilmed at Reactathon September 2018 at GitHub in San Francisco, CA\n\nOrganized by Real World React.

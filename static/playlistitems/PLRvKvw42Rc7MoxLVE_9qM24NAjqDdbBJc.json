        "title": "The Future of React is Us: Theo Browne",
        "description": "The future of React is us\nFrom components to JSX to hooks, React has been a beacon of innovation for the web dev world. It didn’t start that way though. When we first saw React’s abstractions in 2012, we were horrified. We eventually were convinced. Now, the roles have reversed. Gatsby, Next and Remix all showed the need for React on the server. It took a bit, but the React team caught on. For the last decade, the community has adopted React’s innovative patterns. This time is different. The innovation of Server Components didn’t come from React. It came from us. In this talk, I’ll be discussing our responsibilities as the new shepherds of React, the React community itself.\n\nAbout Theo\nTheo is a strange mix of full stack dev, youtuber, shitposter and CEO. After helping Twitch migrate to React and TypeScript, he started ping.gg. He's known for creating the T3 Stack and pushing the limits of typesafety.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023. Learn more at https://reactathon.com",

        "description": "A Component is worth a thousand APIs\nAfter a decade of REST APIs, developer tools have evolved to speak a new language: React Components. From Next.js's \"Image\" to Clerk's \"SignIn\", components have rewritten the rulebook for how much power can be packed into a single line of code. They bundle a frontend with an API, and offer a ridiculously fast, 'lego block' integration experience. But what makes a good component? There is no REST convention to follow, and publishers have landed on dramatically fragmented solutions to challenges like styling, routing, and composability. In this talk, we'll explore the rise of components as the ideal developer tool, and unpack the tradeoffs among these fragmented approaches.\n\nAbout Colin\nColin is co-founder of Clerk, where he helps build authentication and user management tools for React. He has 15 years of frontend experience and is obsessed with making frontend developers more autonomous.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023. Learn more at https://reactathon.com",

        "description": "Splitting the Work: Streaming Server Rendering with Suspense\nMany React developers use server rendering to improve performance. Before React 18, however, all four (4) steps in the server rendering process (data fetching, rendering to HTML, loading JavaScript, and hydrating) had to be completed for the entire app at once. This meant that a bigger or more complex part of your app would block other parts from moving onto the next step, making your app appear slower. Thanks to optimizations in React 18, you can use Suspense to break your app into smaller parts that go through these steps independently. Users benefit from an app that they can see sooner and interact with almost instantaneously!\n\nAbout Shaundai\nShaundai is a Senior Software Engineer (Netflix) and TC39 Delegate based in Atlanta, GA, US. She is passionate about making programming interesting and approachable for all, and does that through her work as a course instructor (tsforjs.com), co-lead for React Robins (reactrobins.com), and technical blogger. In her spare time, Shaundai loves to go hiking, jogging, and listen to audiobooks. Find her on Twitter at @shaundai.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023.

        "description": "The Costs & Benefits of React Server Components\nReact server components (RSC) were initially announced in 2020 and finally made broadly available as a beta via next.js a few months ago. There has been talk and hype around them for years, but genuine understanding of what they are, how they work, and where they shine vs struggle is in short supply. In this talk from the former engineering manager of the next.js team, we'll go into depth on RSC from a balanced perspective, and together we will build a solid understanding of when RSC is the right tool to solve the problems you're facing, and when to look elsewhere. We'll also work through practical examples of RSC in action, and take steps towards shifting your perspective into understanding the new architecture model that RSC sits on top of.\n\nAbout Jeff\nJeff has builds web-tooling-oriented software and manages engineering teams doing the same sort of things. Most recently, he was the manager for the next.js team and for part of the react core team at Vercel, and before that led web development at HashiCorp. Outside of work, he runs a small bagel shop and enjoys woodworking, fitness, and playing music.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023. Learn more at https://reactathon.com",

        "description": "Unlocking the Mystery of React's Re-Rendering\nYour users will not care what tech you used but how fast your app loads. Have you used a hot new stack that everyone loves but still don’t know how to make it performant? Well, it’s because we think about performance as a after-thought after it becomes a bottleneck and when our infra gets costly, ouch! But there is a way to solve this, introducing Core React. We won’t be introducing new tools but going back to how we need to tell React what the DOM should look like. In this talk, we will finally understand why useCallback and useMemo are used, why Lighthouse doesn’t represent performance, how we can minimize component re-render, why it re-renders? and lastly how to profile it with React devtools.\n\nAbout Ankita\nAnkita is an Educator and teaches courses online or sells digital products, such as her Next.js course or her course program on transforming devs into engineering leads. She has taught over 10,000 students online. Ankita has architected and scaled many web and mobile apps for clients using React, GraphQL, React Native and Next.js. She also shares weekly Leadership and Frontend Snacks in her Newsletter at http://bit.ly/42eCi7k.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023. Learn more at https://reactathon.com",

        "description": "The long-tail of type safety\nSo you've added TypeScript to your codebase, tweaked your tsconfig file and you're flying high with the confidence of no more runtime exceptions and the joy of being able to confidently refactor your code, right? I've been there, it's a great feeling. But as you soon discover, adding TS to your code is only the first step of true end-to-end type safety. In fact, it's likely the easiest step. What about API calls, databases, parsed JSON, query string parameters, request and response bodies, session storage and all those third party libraries and SDKs? These are the I/O boundaries of your application and they can destroy your otherwise flawless type safety. In this talk I'll walk you through the long tail of type safety, approaches to implementing type-safety in the overlooked areas of your stack, and tools to help you do so. You'll come away from this talk well equipped to make your codebase more robust and resilient to runtime exceptions. And best of all you'll get that sweet TypeScript confidence back again!\n\nAbout Simon\nSimon is a YC Founder, software engineer, speaker and educator.

        "description": "Making state management intelligent\nManaging state is complicated. Humans are even more complicated. As developers, it's our job to deliver seamless and intuitive user experiences, but the sheer complexity of human behavior and the real world can make this a daunting task. In this talk, we'll explore a radical new approach to app development where language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to handle app logic in a more intelligent and human-centric way. We're bringing artificial intelligence to state management in ways that go much, much further than calling the ChatGPT API. You will learn how you can leverage AI in your existing code to create the best UX possible, and peer into the future of AI and the path to AGI.\n\nAbout David\nDavid is a software engineer who loves playing piano and is passionate about animations, state machines, cutting-edge user interfaces, and open-source. Previously at Microsoft, he is now the founder of Stately, a startup focused on making even the most complex application logic visual and accessible to developers and non-developers alike.\n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023.

        "description": "The future of frontend development in the age of AI & AGI\nArtificial intelligence has made heretofore unfathomable gains in capability, utility, and popularity since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. The impressive capabilities are usurped only by the speed at which they are evolving and improving. So what does this mean for frontend development -- or for engineering itself? These are fascinating questions to explore -- with a potential for a paradigmatic shift the likes of which we haven't seen since the Industrial Revolution or the dawn of the World Wide Web. Join us as we discuss these ideas and more with Sean Grove & Swyx -- who will help us to contextualize these changes with insight and even some demonstrations of the technologies & concepts discussed.\n\nAbout Sean Grove\nSean Grove is a seasoned tech leader and software engineer who's passionate about innovation and making complex problems simple. With a strong background in programming languages like Rust, Clojure, and OCaml, Sean is uniquely positioned to bridge cutting-edge technology with real-world solutions. He has even founded two Y-Combinator startups and sold OneGraph to Netlify in 2021, where he now serves as Principal Architect. Recently, Sean has ventured into the world of machine learning, working on projects like Journaliza, Prator, and Prof Dumbot. These projects aim to help developers and users leverage AI to enhance productivity and communication, and he's firmly in the camp that this is only the beginning of how ML will impact daily life and developer tooling. His passion for exploring new frontiers in this exciting and rapidly evolving field is contagious, and he's always eager to push the limits of what's possible with technology.\n\nAbout Shawn Swyx Wang\nWwyx has helped Developer Tools cross the chasm at AWS, Two Sigma, and three devtool unicorns - Netlify, Temporal, and most recently at Airbyte. He has started and run communities for hundreds of thousands of developers, like Svelte Society, /r/reactjs, and the React TypeScript Cheatsheet. His blog (https://swyx.io/ideas) covers Tech, Careers, and Indie Hacking, and his nontechnical writing was published in the Coding Career Handbook for Junior to Senior developers. He's currently writing and podcasting on AI at https://latent.space \n\nRecorded live in San Francisco at Reactathon 2023. Learn more at https://reactathon.com",

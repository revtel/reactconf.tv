But there's still a lot of work to be done for GraphQL to go totally mainstream and retain its momentum. In this talk, I'll highlight the top cross-cutting technical and tooling challenges that practitioners face in getting GraphQL adopted and hope to spark new ideas and discussions around what we need to spec out, what we need to build and what need to improve! I'm excited to share a list of opportunities and ideas that encompass a) the boring things that need to be done (eg: health-check & error handling!), b) the hard problems that need to be solved (eg: rate-limiting & security) and c) the exciting challenges (eg: GraphQL & wasm) facing us as a GraphQL community. I hope that at the end of the talk we have a real sense of what the top challenges are and why, and that we're excited about going into 2021 discussing these challenges and building potential solutions.",

One of the greatest powers we have as developers is the ability to access and manipulate raw data with ease. But it takes a lot of context to know how to write a SQL query or use an API or make a CURL request. A lot of our energy in the GraphQL community is spent moving the specification forward and improving developer tools around it, but we don't spend much time talking about what GraphQL can do to help people in our organizations beyond our developers –– our designers, product managers, business leaders, customer success engineers, etc. In this talk, I will share the outcomes of some research we did at Apollo on GraphQL accessibility, and my vision for how GraphQL can connect humans to data that impacts them much more effectively, thereby giving them an ability to answer their own questions.",

        "description": "Talk recording from GraphQL Galaxy Conference 2020\nWebsite - https://graphqlgalaxy.com\n\nWatch the full version of the all conference talks including QnA sessions and panel discussions with the inventors of GraphQL on GitNation Video platform , follow the link → http://bit.ly/3pQnGay\n\nOne of the benefits of GraphQL is that it enables a single entry point into any number of back end service or databases. More and more companies are adopting cloud technologies – leading to more jobs, more money, and more opportunities in cloud computing. When GraphQL is integrated with a cloud back end, enabling secure and direct access to dozens of databases and managed services, the limitations are endless. The problem is often that building out these implementations from scratch, and getting them right, is hard. In this talk, I’ll show how you can build cloud-based GraphQL back ends connecting to multiple databases (SQL and NoSQL), serverless functions, machine learning services, and microservices using TypeScript, AppSync, and AWS CDK – and do so in fewer lines of code than you’d expect. We’ll also look at how subscriptions, security, caching, and authentication are all handled, enabling you to build APIs that can simultaneously connect to tens of millions of clients at once to offer true real-time applications at scale. By the end of the talk, you should feel comfortable knowing that you can become a cloud engineer using an existing GraphQL skillset.",

This is particularly undesirable during prototyping phases where the main goal may be just to demonstrate an idea or design. It’s also risky when going to production since data inconsistencies between the layers can lead to bugs.\n \nNexus Schema is a library for building code-first, type-safe GraphQL APIs and can greatly help with this velocity and type-safety dilemma. In this talk, we'll look at how to build GraphQL APIs faster and with the benefits of type safety using Nexus Schema.",

There's a lot of information on how you can use GraphQL to make your APIs more readable or even more content on using GraphQL as a data layer for your existing APIs. This all makes perfect sense, but what if you actually want to know how to transform existing services to GraphQL? In this talk I'll demonstrate how you can use your existing services to create GraphQL schemas using Abstract Syntax Trees and TypeScript.\n \nThis is not a talk to show how to wrap services with GraphQL, in this talk I'll show data models to use an AST to transform existing services to GraphQL.

        "description": "Talk recording from GraphQL Galaxy Conference 2020\nWebsite - https://graphqlgalaxy.com\n\nWatch the full version of the all conference talks including QnA sessions and panel discussions with the inventors of GraphQL on GitNation Video platform , follow the link → http://bit.ly/3pQnGay\n\nOff late GraphQL workloads see wide adoption in enterprise workloads as GraphQL provides a consistent and flexible way for UI to consume data from the APIs. For API developers like me, seeing GraphQL servers abstracting away the data filtering and the access patterns associated with backend APIs is a complete paradigm shift. Traditional API design tasks, like data modeling, access patterns required to implement high-performance Data APIs, are still relevant when implementing GraphQL applications?\n \n This talk will walk you through the learnings as a backend API developer building a hello world GraphQL application to implement a globally distributed GraphQL API for a real-world e-commerce application. We will look into scaling and resiliency required for building high-performance GraphQL APIs. Also, look into how database capabilities play an essential role in implementing a successful GraphQL application.",

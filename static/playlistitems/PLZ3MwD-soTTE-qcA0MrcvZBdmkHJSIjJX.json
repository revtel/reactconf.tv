        "title": "Bringing the New React Native Architecture to the OSS community - N. Corti | React Native EU 2022",
        "description": "At the end of 2021, we successfully rolled out the New React Native Architecture in the Facebook app. Now, it’s time to empower every React Native developer on the globe to use the New React Native Architecture, both the new Fabric renderer and the new TurboModule system. But migrating an entire ecosystem to a New Architecture is no easy task. To support the whole community in this endeavor, we lined up a set of tools and materials that will help both app and library developers to join us in this journey. In the talk, we will present how the New React Native Architecture looks in the OSS space. We will discuss the impact this will have on developing React Native projects. Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nNicola Corti is a Google Developer Expert for Kotlin. He has been working with the language since before version 1.0, and he is the maintainer of several open-source libraries and tools for mobile developers. He's currently working in the React Native Core team at Meta, building one of the most popular cross-platform mobile framework. Furthermore, he is an active member of the developer community. His involvement goes from speaking at international conferences to being a member of CFP committees and supporting developer communities across Europe. In his free time, he also loves baking, podcasting, and running.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

        "title": "Changing React Native... from within! - Adam Foxman | React Native EU 2022",
        "description": "React Native has been used across Microsoft a lot, over the last few years. Only recently, though, we have realized how its developer experience and its community are in a precarious situation. We decided, then, to approach the problem in the most impactful way possible: by going straight to the source! Join us in this talk to hear what we are doing to make life better for everyone in the community, from open sourcing new tools, to creating new cross-company groups and even in collaborating directly with Meta in the core codebase (and not just there!). As a smart person once said: “a rising tide lifts all boats” - and we, we want to be the moon!\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nAdam is a principal software engineer at Microsoft. He spent his first 20 years building C++ apps and products, and in 2018, he made the leap to JavaScript and React Native and hasn't looked back. Adam is a developer experience enthusiast, a tool builder, and a creative storyteller. When Adam's not working, he's adventuring with his family, making something out of wood or Lego, working on his house, or tinkering with some new piece of tech.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

        "description": "The JavaScript Interface (JSI) allows us to access native APIs directly from the JS context. Unlike traditional JSON bridge-based native modules, API access is synchronous and even non-serialisable data types can be expressed. However, JSI is largely undocumented, so it may be unclear how to use it. In this talk, we'll learn how to write JSI code to bridge any individual API from the Objective-C runtime to JS and demonstrate how we could even bridge *all* the APIs the Objective-C runtime offers, by walking through the approach used in the shirakaba/react-native-native-runtime GitHub repository.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nA cross-platform hobbyist and ex-Smart TV app developer, Jamie enjoys putting JavaScript in places it doesn't belong, usually with a view to building apps for foreign language study.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

It seems like a no-win situation: whether you rewrite it, do a \"\"refactoring sprint,\"\" or just live with it, you have to pay a big cost. But these aren't the only options. There's a way to get control of your code so that you can make whatever improvements you need in a low-stress, low-cost way. To explain how, this talk is split into two parts. In the first part we'll look at a messy React Native component and see how effortless it is to make improvements to the code if you have comprehensive tests. In the second part we'll tackle that big \"\"if:\"\" how in the world can you get comprehensive tests like that? By the end of this talk you'll have the information to decide if this approach to testing and refactoring will help your project, and if so, you'll have next steps to hone your skills in this approach.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nJosh Justice has worked as a developer for 17 years across mobile, frontend, and backend platforms.

It is the principle behind every map viewer (google maps, apple plans, leaflet etc.). Our use case was to give our users the ability to view and add markers on building floor plans, with sufficient precision (hence a good zooming ability) and with good performance (network and interactions) in order to be usable on site. From a proof of concept using react-native-maps, we moved to a home made production component built with reanimated 2, fully written in javascript under 500 lines of code.

        "title": "Stripe React Native: A simple set of solutions to a complex set of problems - C.Cruzan | RN EU 2022",
        "description": "Stripe React Native: A simple set of solutions to a complex set of problems Collecting payments in an app is notoriously difficult. Before you get started, you need to decide whether you can collect payments directly, or if you need go through in app purchases. Then the wide world of different payment methods, security, PCI compliance, optimized checkout flows, and more awaits you. That isn’t a task list that gets many developers excited With Stripe’s React Native libraries, our goal is to provide a broad set of solutions for any payment scenario an app might have. This doesn’t just mean exposing a method to charge card details though. Today we’ll go through some of the features offered by Stripe React Native, when/why you’d use them, and then go through a quick demo. 1. Payment Elements like CardField, AuBECS Form, and Bank redirects, which you can use to create payment methods for customers, no matter where they are or what payment methods they use 2. Don’t feel like spending weeks of engineering time on a Checkout flow in your app? Stripe provides the PaymentSheet which can now be customized and tailored to your app’s own UI. With PaymentSheet, your checkout flow is already optimized, and you can start accepting new payment methods without even shipping out an app update (that’s right, server-side controls!) 3. We’ve mentioned payment methods a lot. Something that’s easily forgotten, especially by me living in a country where credit cards are so ubiquitous, is that if your business plans on operating on an international or global scale, you need to support the payment methods that your customers are comfortable and familiar with. Luckily, whether you’re using PaymentSheet or your own checkout flow, Stripe React Native supports over 20 payment methods. 4. What would a mobile payment talk even be if I didn’t mention Apple Pay and Google Pay? Of course Stripe React native supports the full suite of APIs from each, which means you’re not giving up anything by working in React Native. In addition to that, you even have access to the more specific use cases like adding cards to a users native mobile wallet! demo of the Payment Sheet with customized appearance - when to use the payment sheet demo of custom UI using CardField - when to use the individual elements and build your own checkout flow demo of adding a card to your native wallet ? - this might be too specific of a use case Last slide on Stripe’s future plans for React Native- releasing first-class support for it with new mobile features: insert new libraries that are currently unreleased but will be available before the talk itself\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nCharlie is a software engineer at Stripe, where he works on ensuring developers using Stripe have powerful tools at their disposal to get their work done efficiently, and enjoyably! One of his focuses is the Stripe React Native SDK, which allows you to build delightful payment experiences faster and easier than ever.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

        "description": "While code goes through a build/release workflow, and your app handles user data, there is a middle ground of \"\"Content Management\"\". Servers can provide content and configuration to continuously tweak the behavior of your app in the wild. How can we make this process easier and more robust? What happens if we blur the lines between your app's user data, content, and code? With React Native's primitives, can we re-attach the front end of the \"\"Headless CMS\"\", and directly render our content on every platform?\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nEric is self-taught software engineer who has used React since the year it was released.

        "description": "Flipper is a platform for debugging mobile and web apps. Half a year ago, we decided to split the electron monolith in two parts: a standalone server and a UI. In this talk, we'll cover why you need headless Flipper, what opportunities it unlocks for you. We’ll go over how Flipper can now be easily used for remote debugging, embedding, CI integration, and etc. We’ll overview how Flipper architecture transformed to support the migration, what Flipper is now, and how we plan to use it at Meta.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nHi there 👋 My name is Andrey G. I am a software engineer from London, UK. Primarily, I am a full-stack web developer (think React, Angular, Node.js), but I also have a keen interest in low-level stuff (hello, C) and finance (love-hate relationship with Pandas). Career: Full-stack (web, blockchain, and even a bit of embedded) at software consultancies - Headed front-end development at Hazelcast - Front-end at Bricks (next-gen spreadsheet web app) - Full-time maintainer of Flipper at Meta (ex-Facebook). I write about tech in my small blog. Occasionally, I speak at conferences. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science (OMSCS) from Georgia Tech. I love math, physics, rational thinking, and figuring out how things work. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, boxing, and weight lifting.",

        "description": "Localization (l10n), is the process of adapting applications and text to enable their usability in a particular market. From a dev standpoint, what immediately comes to mind is translating strings instead of hardcoding them - but there's much more to the topic. In the talk, I want to cover the following: - Different approaches to managing translation strings, and different libraries / tools which do that with React. - What mistakes can happen during localization and how to prevent them. - Through which services can I get my app translated, and explain a little about how translators themselves work. - What should I (not) do to help translators deliver quality translations. - At which points in the development process we can localize (coding, or perhaps already in design phase?). After the talk, I want the audience to have and understanding what tools are available to them, how to approach SW localization and how to (not) do it.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nVojtech has been coding React Native stuff for the past few years.

        "title": "The component anatomy, 90° to the left - A. Ngangoue-Nyangwile | React Native EU 2022",
        "description": "Is it possible to discuss the code complexity without having to write any code ? Can I visualize the coupling and the cohesion of my code unit thanks to a simple drawing ? Which support could allow developers to challenge their architecture ? Is it possible to have a simplified diagram (UML equivalent) of any components ? This is the kind of questions the Component Anatomy tries to answer. By making parallels with the construction area, the component anatomy is a descriptive method that attempts to make the code “visualizable” by introducing 2 concepts: **Structure** and **Data flows** along with one principle: looking for the closed circuits.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

        "title": "How to actually improve the performance of a React Native app? - M. Chudziak | React Native EU 2022",
        "description": "Have you ever searched the internet for tips for improving React Native performance? Did you find many materials including various optimization techniques but you weren’t sure where to apply them? Did you manage to solve some issues, but they came back after some time? The user's interaction with the application is a process. A process that could be optimized like any other. UI/UX experts are working hard on doing it from a layout perspective, but we can also improve it from a purely technical side. During this talk, I'll walk you through the robust methodology of performance optimization of any application and show you how to apply it in React Native.\n\nSpeaker Bio\n\nMichał is an experienced technical consultant and software development freak. He loves React Native, and he's been buliding builds its ecosystem since early 2016. Former Head of Delivery at Callstack, now he helps other companies ship amazing products and build high-performing teams.\n\nCheck out more about React Native EU conference:\nhttps://www.react-native.eu/\n\nand follow us on Twitter to stay up to date: \nhttps://twitter.com/react_native_eu",

After all, they’re both all about being in charge - who gets to render, who gets to update, who gets to decide how things should look... the story goes on and on. But with these two, as in life, the best relationship is about compromise and sharing responsibilities. So, how can we turn a tug-of-war into a beautiful, responsive, animated tango? Enter, React hooks!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In principle, you can paint almost anything you can dream of. In practice, WebGL is hard, and though projects like three.js make it easier, there are still a lot of hurdles to integrating it into your site in a practical way.\n\nLet's explore how Hooks can make it easier to integrate powerful GPU-driven visuals into our React apps, giving us the best of both worlds: the power of WebGL with the ease and expressiveness of a React component tree.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

If we can’t read our own code after a few months, how can we expect anybody else to? What kind of effect does this have on developer productivity and overall project robustness? This talk explores how Emma and her team were able to make a client’s React codebase more readable and improve communication and productivity by leveraging technologies like TypeScript, GraphQL, and React hooks in a rewrite of the client's website.\n\nIncrease the speed at which new developers are able to onboard to your project, cut down on the time between when a PR is submitted and when it’s merged, and streamline the bug squashing process.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Not sure what useImperativeHandle does? This talk is a nice step-by-step intro to React hooks and some advanced patterns around them. We're going to build a tiny router for React with API similar to React Router's one.\n\nAbout Alexey https://twitter.com/mlfrg\nAlexey is a full-stack developer with over 10 years of experience. His primary stack includes React, Node.js and Ruby on Rails. While he mainly works with backend/infrastructure as a head of engineering of resume.io (a project he cofounded in 2016), he's also super passionate about design and user interfaces. A true hackathon addict, Alexey believes that working on an open-source project is no different than working on a product and that good design is the main driving factor of a successful project.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

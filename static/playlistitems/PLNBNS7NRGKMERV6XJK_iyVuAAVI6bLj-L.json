        "description": "Talk recording from React Day Berlin Conference 2019\n  \nCheck out the latest React Day Berlin news – https://reactday.berlin\n\nSee other React conferences by GitNation\nReact Summit Amsterdam – https://reactsummit.com\nReact Advanced London – https://reactadvanced.com\n\n# Strong RESTful Contracts in a GraphQL world\nGraphQL is an incredible technology. It provides developers with concrete, solid guarantees at the API layer, preventing surprises when interacting with client-server applications. REST has been often criticized as weaker in this regard, since it is not a formal specification. This talk explores working with similar (if not better) contractually-sound REST APIs in a React application using powerful new tooling.\n\nTejas Kumar\nTejas enjoys people, code, and talking about code to people. Having begun coding at age 8, today Tejas travels around the world, encouraging, educating and empowering developers in the web development community.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You announce the conference, start planning the venue, getting sponsors, & fielding talks. Things start getting serious, & before you know it you’re overloaded with obligations. Oh, & you forgot: You also need a conference app!\n\nYou don’t just want any conference app; you want it to be fun, engaging, & a valuable addition to the attendees. How can you do this in the least amount of time?\n\nIn this talk, I’ll show how you can rapidly prototype, build, & deploy your app using GraphQL, React Native, & AWS AppSync so you can spend your time worrying about more important things in life. In addition to what you’d expect from a conference app, we’ll be adding live chat so attendees discuss talks & speakers can field questions & interact with them in real-time.\"\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

If we can’t read our own code after a few months, how can we expect anybody else to? What kind of effect does this have on developer productivity and overall project robustness? This talk explores how Emma and her team were able to make a client’s React codebase more readable and improve communication and productivity by leveraging technologies like TypeScript, GraphQL, and React hooks in a rewrite of the client's website.\n\nIncrease the speed at which new developers are able to onboard to your project, cut down on the time between when a PR is submitted and when it’s merged, and streamline the bug squashing process.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

What databases or search engines can I use it with? How do you aggregate data from multiple sources globally? Can GraphQL fetched data be available offline, and if clients mutate it how are conflicts resolved? Is there a secure way to control data access based on user authentication? Do subscriptions scale to thousands or millions of users? How do I use it with content like images or video? We’ll learn about AWS AppSync, a managed GraphQL service with offline and realtime features, and see the latest features and functionality that have just been released to market.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Even though it's based on a type system, GraphQL in many ways is more flexible than REST. But the flexibility that makes GraphQL a joy to work with can have its downsides if you aren't careful.\n\nSchema design is an area where one small oversight at the beginning can get you stuck having to deal with weird naming, bloated duplicates, and other annoying workarounds. It doesn't have to be like this! \n\nNik Graf has extensive experience designing GraphQL schemas, for a variety of business applications.Nik has prepared several examples following different design patterns. Through exploration and comparison, you'll come away with actionable knowledge for designing and extending schemas.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was released by Facebook back in 2015 and has since started to gain traction with both large and small companies using it for their APIs, most recently Github. \nAs described on graphql.org:“GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.” \nWe got introduced to GraphQL over a year ago and were impressed by its promise. Since then we have discovered patterns on how to best structure and implement a GraphQL API. In this talk we will share some of these patterns and provide examples on how to implement them.\n\nLink to event page https://www.meetup.com/React-Amsterdam/events/237423993/\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You will see how to make the collaborative parts of your app update in real time with little extra code, how to integrate with a SQL database or REST API, and how this works in concert with GraphQL’s best features to simplify your app’s data management while being predictable and maintainable.\n\nSlides are here https://speakerdeck.com/reactamsterdam/martijn-walraven-meteor-amsterdam-building-reactive-graphql-apps-with-apollo\n\nIf you tweet, don't forget to #reactamsterdam tag it!\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Talk recording from React Summit Remote Edition 2020\n\nWebsite - https://remote.reactsummit.com/\n\n\nSee other React conferences by GitNation\nReact Summit – https://reactsummit.com\nReact Advanced London – https://reactadvanced.com\nReact Day Berlin – https://reactday.berlin/\n\n\n#GraphQL Mesh – Query Anything, Run Anywhere\nIn this talk I will demonstrate the new GraphQL Mesh library (https://twitter.com/UriGoldshtein/status/1242118500795236353?s=20) that was recently announced.\nGraphQL Mesh changes a lot of the traditional ideas about GraphQL and its relationship with other API protocols.\nIt can automatically generate a GraphQL API from openapi/Swagger, gRPC, SOAP, oData and others without changing the source and merge them all schemas into a single schema - Schema Stitching for any source!\nIn this talk I will share some of the original ideas behind it and my opinions on how the future looks for API consumption and exposure.\n\n\nUri Goldshtein\nUri is the founder of The Guild, a group of open source developers working around the world to help create important open source libraries, mostly around GraphQL. They support large companies to go through successful technological transformations.\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In Kitze's previous talks, he always included a short bit about this topic, and it resonated well with the audience. This time, he does a full talk on it because everyone is struggling with this problem.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Styling? Got it. Animations? A little different, but sure. Now let's add a navigation bar and another screen that we transition to...\nThis is where you hit a fork in the road. You can either use a library that wraps the native navigation APIs for the platform or a re-implementation of those APIs using the same React Native primitives (View, Text, Animated, etc) that you use throughout your app. The former is commonly called “native navigation\" because most of the implementation is in \"native\" and the latter is called \"JavaScript-based navigation\" because most of the implementation is in JavaScript. React Navigation is a \"JavaScript-based\" navigation solution and React Native Navigation is a \"native\" navigation library. The choice you make has a significant impact on your app, and it's something you will live with every day while you continue to work on the project.\nI lead the React Navigation along with the creator of the project, Eric Vicenti. I'll explain why we think that building a JavaScript-based navigation library is important, what the limitations are (why there is room for both categories of solutions), and I'll show you how to take full advantage of it.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

You quickly add some hello world text and maybe even a Pokemon image. Things are really starting to look up… \nAnd then you need to add another view and you realize that you need to navigate somewhere. So you check out the React Native Docs and are quickly greeted by IOSTabBar, Navigation, and NavigationExperimental modules. With so many different options in the core codebase you realize that it’s still a bit of an unsolved problem. Now you’re looking at 3rd party integrations… and you start to wonder, just how should you implement navigation? \nThis talk will outline the different approaches to navigation available in React Native and in the RN eco-system, and the pro’s and con’s of each solution.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

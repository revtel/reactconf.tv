        "description": "Talk recording from React Amsterdam 2019 Conference  \n\nCheck out the latest React Summit Amsterdam news – https://reactsummit.com\n\nSee other React conferences by GitNation\nReact Day Berlin – https://reactday.berlin\nReact Advanced London – https://reactadvanced.com\n\n# Requisite React\n# General Track\n\nReact is a brilliant JavaScript library for building simple and complex user interfaces. In our eagerness to apply React to our most complex of problems and ship solutions today, we can get lost in the 🌲🌲🌲 forest of abstractions 🌲🌲🌲. When it comes to leveling up our skills in anything, Kent finds the most effective method is to take a step back and understand the foundational fundamentals. To strip away all abstraction until what we're left with is the bare bones. The better you understand an abstraction, the more effective you will be at using it. This talk will help you get more effective at using React Hooks, React Suspense, and JSX.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Take a look at the internals of React Native, and how code written in JavaScript can power a fully native mobile application. See the various parts of the current system like the bridge, the UI manager and the plugins. The talks also touches upon the rendering process and compare it to React’s rendering on the web.\n\nSee some of the new and exciting improvements (like Fabric, TurboModules and JSI) and how they significantly improve React Native. This talk stems from Parashuram's experiences as a web-developer newbie on the React Native team, and is an attempt to document his journey in comprehending the code base. At the end of the talk, the attendees will not only be able to build React Native apps, but also understands how it all works together.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

However, few take into consideration the impacts these will have on performance of the application. In this talk you’ll find out how some commonly used patterns have an adverse effect on the speed of your app, and how to avoid using them. The talk explorse UI and state management but also dives into some native-specific issues and look at how to prevent them.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

When done successfully, it suddenly becomes trivial to translate standard designs into code. In fact, we may even find that this translation step starts to feel somewhat redundant. In a world of components, how should our design processes change? How should our tooling change? How should we, as React developers, better enable this change? In this talk, you'll see the current state of design and development, and where we could go—if we're willing to push for it.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

This is great because one tech team can build both your web app and native mobile experience. The problem is developers hate writing things twice. There have been a couple of efforts to build a unifying technology to write an application once and have it work on both web and native. Yet this is not always the best approach. There is value in only sharing your business and state logic; keeping your render code separate.\n\nIn this talk, Ben Elerby gives real examples from his work with MADE.COM, migrating their web and mobile application to React and React-Native with code sharing as a primary objective.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Let Designers and Developers talk to each other\n# General Track\n\n“Should designers code?” or “Should coders design?”—these two eternal questions are being asked for years with no particular answer given.\n\n- How to let developers know what typography style or button variance they should be using on this particular screen?\n- How to ensure that the whole UI is consistent?\n- How to let designers know that some screen design doesn’t fit the requirements and needs to be updated?\n\nIn order to answer those questions designers and developers have to speak the same language. But what language should it be? UI components and pattern libraries can provide this intermediate abstraction and be a common language for both designers and developers.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Then you started getting some users and suddenly you needed multiple instances of your Monolith Backend and more replicas of your Database. Your user base kept growing and also your development team was growing, so you split your Monolith backend into Microservices with their own Databases.\n\nYou’re very happy about the situation until you realize that the same problem you had on the backend it’s now on the frontend. Multiple teams are working on the same codebase, it’s hard to do frequent releases and there’re a lot of cross-team communications that slow things down.\n\nDAZN battle-tested the Microfrontends architecture leveraging feature like blue-green deployments in the frontend, framework agnostic teams and drastically reduced cross-team dependencies.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Can we go further and create better-than-native applications? 🤔 Sounds like a good challenge!\n\nThis talk introduces how React, JavaScript and WebAssembly can be used to write new ambitious apps, or port existing ones - with real world examples! Florian shows how to leverage the React ecosystem to create performant applications: architecture, patterns, typing, useful open-source modules and tooling... and how to go one step further and provide a better user experience as well as a better developer experience.\n\nThese apps are not web apps, they are not native apps, they are hybrid 'Native Web Apps' and can provide the best of both worlds.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

React is built primarily for the browser, while Node has fundamentally different operational constraints to the browser. While working as a Principal Architect and Consultant, it has become painfully clear to David that React’s Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a performance bottleneck for web backends around the world. This talk demonstrates a very simple solution that can be dropped into pre-existing React applications to vastly improve the throughput of an SSR Node server (around 20-40x+).\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

In principle, you can paint almost anything you can dream of. In practice, WebGL is hard, and though projects like three.js make it easier, there are still a lot of hurdles to integrating it into your site in a practical way.\n\nLet's explore how Hooks can make it easier to integrate powerful GPU-driven visuals into our React apps, giving us the best of both worlds: the power of WebGL with the ease and expressiveness of a React component tree.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

Adam's team could have pursued a typical release strategy—instead, they got creative with React Native.\n\nThey built a strangler-style architecture, a technique commonly reserved for web services, to release our greenfield React Native product user-by-user. The effect was some pretty unique and awesome advantages to how we built and tested our new app—but software is never perfect.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

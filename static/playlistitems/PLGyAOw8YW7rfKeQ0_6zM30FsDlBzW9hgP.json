        "description": "About the session\nUnderstanding the new Suspense SSR architecture in React 18\n\nReact's server-side rendering (SSR) is preferred by many developers to improve performance & SEO. SSR involves 4 steps i.e. fetching your app data & rendering to HTML on the server and loading the JavaScript code & hydration on the client-side. Before React 18, each of these steps had to be completed one after other for the entire app. This could cause the bigger & slower part of your app to block the other parts, affecting the UX.Current optimisations in React 18 allow you to use Suspense to split your app into smaller parts that will go through these steps independently. Users can now view the content sooner and start interacting with it much faster.\n\n\nKirti Vernekar is a web developer and product design enthusiast. She love designing and building digital experiences. She is a huge believer in the idea of simplifying UI and maximising UX! When not juggling with tabs, She enjoy making 3D art and talking about fiction.",

        "description": "AR is a fascinating topic as more and more AR apps hit the stores. React Native is also really popular, but there is a problem in combining the two. Developing AR apps with React Native has been always a challenge. Few years back solution was ViroReact, but it mostly provided a way to develop really simple apps. What if we want to develop full blown AR app and integrate it into existing React Native app? Is it possible at all? And if so how we can do that? In this talk Vladimir will explain how you can create AR app using 3D engine such as Unity and integrate into existing React Native app.\n\nAbout Vladimir \n\nIndependent consultant, software architect, worldwide speaker, trainer, published author. On a daily basis, Vladimir works in Web and Mobile fields advocating the usage of GraphQL, React Native, Cloud-native and Serverless architectures with emphasis on scalability, code quality and best practices.",

I'll showcase the unique features of the file-based plugin system, such as persistent storage per plugin, registration of components, routes, and functions, and a cross-plugin event system. The talk also shares the story of how and why I solved this problem to make developers' lives easier. Check out the experiment at https://github.com/gluestack/next-wordpress-plugins.\n\n\nAbout Sanket \n\nHe found my love for computers at the age of 8 and haven’t looked back ever since. He built a bunch of products (builderX) and OSS (NativeBase) and lead a consulting company of 500+ folks. He is very fortunate to combine my two passions, design and code, into what he does for a living. Sanket is founder at GeekyAnts and still a developer at heart. Currently, he spend my days in his self designed caravan, learning what it’s like to live as a digital nomad and I can’t wait to share my stories with you!",

        "description": "In this talk we will explore the concept of predictive prefetching and how it increases the web performance and INP(Interaction to Next Paint) score.\nAs we at 1mg always focus on enhancing user experience and setting new benchmarks for performance, we believe that by anticipating user actions and proactively fetching the necessary resources in advance, we can drastically improve the user experience and achieve performance similar to that of native applications.\n\nAs we built the prefetching module, we built it as a standalone library so that you can plug it into any project. Also we fine tuned the package to handle most of the things on its own like not fetching too many resources as it's a waste of user’s data bandwidth and clearing existing data fetching processes on user navigation. Optimize the prefetching process to work seamlessly across different devices and network conditions.\n\nWhat have we built:\n- Route prefetching package which you can integrate to any JS framework. This package accepts either the routes for which we want to prefetch bundles or direct link to the resource.\n- React hooks over the package to easily integrate with a React Project.\n- A webpack plugin which reads your projects routes file and generates routes(navigation links) to JS bundles mapping. It supports both Loadable and React Lazy chunking.\n- A client to fetch next routes based on the user's current journey and also push the events data to your AI model.\n- Also we have built another layer if you don’t want to use the AI model to get routes you can use this layer to fetch resources for the links available in the current view of the page which we are updating as user scroll using JS Intersection Observer API.",

In this lightning talk, I'll discuss about a tool that we're working on which uses react-scanner and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with custom scripts to generate component usage data for a React design system.\n\nThe talk will cover how we generate this data and how it is rendered in a dashboard to provide valuable insights on the coverage of the design system.\n\n- Introduction to react-scanner\n- Measuring Component Usage\n- Identifying Native HTML elements and Styled Components\n- Showing Tree structure of Page in terms of Components\n- Highlighting Anti Patterns\n- Benefits / Use Cases for this tool",

        "title": "Sebastian McKenzie - Improving Your Workflow With Code Transformation at react-europe 2015",
        "description": "Most React developers already use a build pipeline to transform their JSX into vanilla JavaScript. This is usually under-utilised only doing basic transformations such as concatenation, minification and linting. In this talk, Sebastian will go over how this already existing infrastructure can be further utilised to perform even more significant code transformations such as transpilation, optimisation, profiling and more, reducing bugs, making your code faster and you as a developer more productive and happy.",

        "description": "At Twitter, teams have starting adopting React because it’s enabled UI engineers to forget about time when writing rendering code. And we've started exploring similar simplifications in the data layer, embracing the UI’s role as part of a distributed system. First, we'll share how user experience choices are a primary influence on how we design the data layer, especially for teams developing new products with full-stack capabilities. Working with data from multiple backend services has powerful benefits, and shapes the problem space for UI engineering. Next, we'll look at how React and Flux approaches can help in our problem scenarios. Yet even after the advances in React’s component model, the data layer is still an important source of complexity as an app grows and changes over time. Finally, we'll look at new approaches we’ve been exploring, and how designs like decoupling 'recording facts' from 'computing views of those facts' have influenced UI engineering. These designs nudge teams towards simplicity when creating impactful user-facing improvements like real-time updates, optimistic commits, and graceful handling of network outages.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/krob",

        "description": "React.js is changing the way developers think about mobile app development, especially with the recent announcement of React Native. However, in many ways hybrid (web + mobile) app development is here to stay for a large number of mobile apps. Everyone's heard \"you can't build a native experience in a web view\". We disagree. You just have to know the right tricks. And when you do, the web becomes an incredibly powerful platform for delivering amazing user experience using the technology you know. At Thinkmill in Sydney, over the course of developing several commercial apps, we've experienced the power of using ReactJS for mobile apps built on web technology, and developed a framework we call TouchstoneJS (which Tom Occhino called \"the best looking and feeling implementation of this that I've seen\" during the Q&A session at React Conf) to share this capability with developers around the world. In this talk I'll share what we've learned and how we've approached the unique challenges of mobile web apps - with tools that are useful to all developers building touch interfaces with React, as well as a walkthrough of our development process and framework. I'll also talk about what you can do with the web platform that you can't with native apps, and even React Native.",

More importantly though, we are focused on bringing great experiences to consumers of applications built using React Router. In this talk, we will discuss how your users can benefit from the many tools the router provides including server-side rendering, real URLs on native devices, and much, much more.",

        "description": "React provides us with a lot of tools for building components, but isn't prescriptive about how we use those. Objects can have props, state, and instance fields. When is it best to use each? We've heard a lot about pure components, but how do we make pure components when we have to deal with the realities of a stateful world? How do we make more complex components whose props actually represent them? We'll cover how we've answered these questions at Khan Academy, including techniques and patterns to make dealing with large pure components simpler, as well as current open questions.",

        "description": "Chrome is great, but 3rd party extensions make it better. The iPhone is great, but apps make it better. You React-app may be great, but imagine if you could safely and robustly allow 3rd party extensions to enhance it. We'll talk about specific features of React & Flux, React CSS, programming design patterns, and custom libraries, which can turn a static application into a dynamic platform that an ecosystem of developers can build on top of. We've built a highly-extensible desktop email client with React & Flux on Atom Shell, and we'll also show concrete examples of where these tools enabled a 3rd party ecosystem of email plugins. Our goal is for you to take away how to use React to be more than just great application developers, but now great platform developers as well.",

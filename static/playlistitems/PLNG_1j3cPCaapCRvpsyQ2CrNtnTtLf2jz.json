        "description": "Joe Savona | Meta\nJoe was planning to major in math and philosophy but got into computer science after writing physics simulations in Matlab. Prior to React, he worked on Relay, RSocket.js, and the Skip programming language. While he‚Äôs not building some sort of reactive system he enjoys running, studying Japanese, and spending time with his family.\nhttps://github.com/josephsavona\nhttps://twitter.com/en_JS\n\nLauren Tan | Meta\nLauren‚Äôs programming career peaked when she first discovered the marquee tag. She‚Äôs been chasing that high ever since. She studied Finance instead of CS in college, so she learned to code using Excel instead of Java. Lauren enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, playing video games with her partner, and petting her dog Zelda.\nhttps://github.com/poteto\nhttps://twitter.com/potetotes\n\nAndrew Clark | Vercel\nAndrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.\nhttps://github.com/acdlite\nhttps://twitter.com/acdlite\n\nJosh Story | Vercel\nJosh majored in Mathematics and discovered programming while in college. His first professional developer job was to program insurance rate calculations in Microsoft Excel, the paragon of Reactive Programming which must be why he now works on React. In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.\nhttps://github.com/gnoff\nhttps://twitter.com/joshcstory\n\nSathya Gunasekaran | Meta\nSathya hated the Dragon Book in school but somehow ended up working on compilers all his career. When he‚Äôs not compiling React components, he‚Äôs either drinking coffee or eating yet another Dosa.\nhttps://github.com/gsathya\nhttps://twitter.com/_gsathya\n\nMofei Zhang | Meta\nMofei started programming when she realized it can help her cheat in video games. She focused on operating systems in undergrad / grad school, but now finds herself happily tinkering on React. Outside of work, she enjoys debugging bouldering problems and planning her next backpacking trip(s).\nhttps://github.com/mofeiZ\n\nThis talk was given as a part of React Conf 2024, co-hosted by Meta (https://www.meta.com) and Callstack (https://www.callstack.com/).

        "description": "RedwoodJS, the full-stack, open source, React web application framework, has adopted React Server Components in a major architectural shift. By combining the strengths of SSR, streaming, Suspense, RSCs, and Server Actions, we have created a new version of Redwood that is both simpler and more capable. In this talk I will share the lessons we learned in implementing RSCs on top of Vite, and dig into how Redwood‚Äôs approach to RSCs differs from Next.js. Come see how we make data fetching (both client- and server-side) trivial with our unique Cell pattern, how to execute server functions from the client, and how our routes file makes complex URLs easy to manage. I will also reveal our roadmap and future innovations you can expect from the framework!\n\nAmy Dutton | RedwoodJS\nAmy loves using her 22 years of internet experience to teach developers how to design, and designers how to develop. She lives in Nashville, TN USA with her husband, 3 adorable kids, and 2 dogs.\nhttps://github.com/ahaywood\nhttps://twitter.com/selfteachme\n\nThis talk was given as a part of React Conf 2024, co-hosted by Meta (https://www.meta.com) and Callstack (https://www.callstack.com/).

As the host of React Podcast, he has shared insights from open source luminaries and engineer-creators. His curious and engaging style has helped aspiring engineers learn React.\nhttps://github.com/chantastic\nhttps://twitter.com/chantastic\n\nLauren Tan | Meta\nLauren‚Äôs programming career peaked when she first discovered the marquee tag. She‚Äôs been chasing that high ever since. She studied Finance instead of CS in college, so she learned to code using Excel instead of Java. Lauren enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, playing video games with her partner, and petting her dog Zelda.\nhttps://github.com/poteto\nhttps://twitter.com/potetotes\n\nMofei Zhang | Meta\nMofei started programming when she realized it can help her cheat in video games. She focused on operating systems in undergrad / grad school, but now finds herself happily tinkering on React. Outside of work, she enjoys debugging bouldering problems and planning her next backpacking trip(s).\nhttps://github.com/mofeiZ\n\nRicky Hanlon | Meta\nRicky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he‚Äôs not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.\nhttps://github.com/rickhanlonii\nhttps://twitter.com/rickhanlonii\n\nJason Bonta | Meta\nJason abandoned embedded-C for a career in front-end engineering and never looked back. Armed with esoteric CSS knowledge and a passion for beautiful UI, Jason joined Facebook in 2010, where he now feels privileged to have seen JavaScript development come of age. Though he may not understand how for-of loops work, he loves getting to work with brilliant people on projects that enable amazing UX.\n\nJoe Savona | Meta\nJoe was planning to major in math and philosophy but got into computer science after writing physics simulations in Matlab. Prior to React, he worked on Relay, RSocket.js, and the Skip programming language. While he‚Äôs not building some sort of reactive system he enjoys running, studying Japanese, and spending time with his family.\nhttps://github.com/josephsavona\nhttps://twitter.com/en_JS\n\nJosh Story | Vercel\nJosh majored in Mathematics and discovered programming while in college. His first professional developer job was to program insurance rate calculations in Microsoft Excel, the paragon of Reactive Programming which must be why he now works on React. In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.\nhttps://github.com/gnoff\nhttps://twitter.com/joshcstory\n\nDan Abramov | Bluesky\nDan got into programming after he accidentally discovered Visual Basic inside Microsoft PowerPoint. He has found his true calling in turning Sebastian‚Äôs tweets into long-form blog posts. Dan occasionally wins at Fortnite by hiding in a bush until the game ends.\nhttps://github.com/gaearon\nhttps://twitter.com/dan_abramov\n\nAndrew Clark | Vercel\nAndrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.\nhttps://github.com/acdlite\nhttps://twitter.com/acdlite\n\nThis Q&A was part of React Conf 2024, co-hosted by Meta (https://www.meta.com) and Callstack (https://www.callstack.com/).

        "description": "Web Accessibility is nuanced and can be a tough topic to navigate and get right. In this talk, I aim to provide a practical guide to web accessibility in React apps, completed with many interactive examples.\n\nWe‚Äôll start with brief introduction to web accessibility as a whole, we will explore the way assistive technology interacts with web pages, how accessibility tree is constructed and used to navigate web content. Then, we‚Äôll go over a few common patterns in React apps and how to implement without compromising accessibility. This is going to be fun!\n\nKateryna Porshnieva | Buffer\nKateryna is an engineer from Ukraine with 10+ years of experience in UI development and design, currently leading front-end direction at Buffer. She is passionate about accessible web, design systems and making complex things simple. Apart from work, she is active in tech community, organises board game nights and is known as a coffee snob.\nhttps://github.com/krambertech\nhttps://twitter.com/krambertech\n\nThis talk was given as a part of React Conf 2024, co-hosted by Meta (https://www.meta.com) and Callstack (https://www.callstack.com/).

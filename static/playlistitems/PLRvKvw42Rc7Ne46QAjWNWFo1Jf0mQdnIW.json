Sometimes you want more control, or your use case is so simple you can avoid bringing in an unneeded dependency, or maybe you just want to strip away the magic for a moment and learn how the browser's drawing APIs really work. We'll go over some examples of building charts with basic HTML, SVG and Canvas.\n\nChristina works on the dashboard team at Pepperdata, building apps to help users get a handle on what's going on with their complex distributed systems. This is her third career after biotech and animation. She likes elegant puzzle solutions, pretty and intuitive UI, and data visualizations that make complex things simple.",

        "description": "GraphQL is quickly becoming mainstream as one of the best ways to get data into your React application. When we see people modernize their app architecture and move to React, they often want to migrate their API to GraphQL as part of the same effort. But while React is super easy to adopt in a small part of your app at a time, GraphQL can seem like a much larger investment. In this talk, we’ll go over the fastest and most effective ways for React developers to incrementally migrate their existing APIs and backends to GraphQL, then talk about opportunities for improvement in the space. If you’re using React and are interested in GraphQL, but are looking for an extra push to get it up and running at your company, this is the talk for you!\n\nSashko has been working on open source developer tools for the last 5 years. Most recently he has been leading open source GraphQL tool development at Apollo, after writing the very first versions of Apollo Client. Previously, he has worked on JavaScript build tooling, reactive UI frameworks, and data visualization.",

        "description": "React is most often associated with Single Page Applications, but tools like Gatsby, React Static, Phenomic and Cuttlebelle has made React hyper-relevant for content driven websites as well. Netlify CMS is an open-source project with the goal of building a content management UI in React. It works with any static site generator, and makes content editors participate in the modern git-centric workflow that developers are used to. This talk will show how to use Netlify CMS with a Gatsby-based site, to build high-performant and infinitely-scalable sites with git-based content editing, a user friendly UI, and live browser previews - all without a backend.\n\nMatt is regarded as one of the driving forces behind the resurgence of static websites and is a founder at Netlify, the fastest growing automation platform for modern websites. Matt has lead the development of all of 3 commercial CMS (swears he won’t do a fourth), has written production code in more than a dozen programming languages, is trilingual and enjoys listening to beer and drinking modern jazz.",

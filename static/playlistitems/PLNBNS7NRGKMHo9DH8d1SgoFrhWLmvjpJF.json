Exciting developments from static site generators like Next.js and Gatsby to server-side rendering evolution, including React Fiber, Hooks, and server components. The pressure on servers in 2020 led to the announcement of server components, a complex but transformative idea. New challenges arise with weaving server and client, requiring adaptation and file organization. Evaluation of React server components' worth based on server-side needs and bundle issues. SPAs are prevalent and valued, despite the focus on client-side apps. TanStack Router offers unparalleled URL state management and type safety, enhancing SPA development. Exciting developments ahead with the DaVinci release, supported by sponsors for TanStack's full-time commitment and core contributors.\n\nWatch the full talk with Q&A on GitNation website: https://gitnation.com/contents/spa-to-ssr-and-everything-in-between\n\nFollow the link to watch the full version of all the conference talks, QnA’s with speakers and hands-on workshop recordings → https://gitnation.com/events/react-summit-2025\n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:00 React's Evolution and Impact\n02:38 React's Server-Side Evolution\n04:22 React's Server Component Revolution\n05:23 Exploring React Server Component Functionality\n07:23 Challenges of Implementing React Server Components\n09:20 New Frontiers in React Server Components\n11:59 React Server Components: Worth and Reality\n13:36 SPA Importance and Development Commitment\n15:34 Advanced Tool for SPA Development\n16:34 Enhanced Type Safety and URL Management\n18:04 Enhanced State Management and Server Integration\n19:44 Exciting Developments and Acknowledgments\n\n🔥 Want to hear talks like this live?

We’ll explore its full process, from parsing to Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformation, along with its key technologies, benefits, trade-offs, and a practical example of how it transforms your code to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n\nThe good news: you (luckily) don’t need to master its internals to integrate it into your codebase. That said, a solid grasp of its internals will significantly enhance your ability to apply the optimization techniques it unlocks!\n\nWatch the full talk with Q&A on GitNation website: https://gitnation.com/contents/react-compiter-internals\n\nFollow the link to watch the full version of all the conference talks, QnA’s with speakers and hands-on workshop recordings → https://gitnation.com/events/react-summit-2025\n\nTimestamps:\n\n00:00 React Compiler and Memoization\n01:49 React Performance Optimization\n03:41 Compiler Optimization Process\n06:12 Single Static Assignment in Compiler\n09:17 Compiler Effect Analysis and Reactive Detection\n12:38 Compiler Scope Discovery and Code Generation\n17:11 Compiler Memoization Optimization\n\n\n🔥 Want to hear talks like this live?

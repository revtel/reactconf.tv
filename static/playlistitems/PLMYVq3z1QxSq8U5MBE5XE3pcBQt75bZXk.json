        "description": "ReactNext\nwww.react-next.com\nIsrael's Annual React & React Native confernce\n@reactnext \n\nMigrating from state management to react-query. I’m sorry, what?!\n\nIt’s time to admit - we were wrong. State management solutions are great, but unfitting for server-side data. Server-side data needs special care, like async behaviour built-in, caching, deduping, refetching, loading states, error states, pagination, and more. And us - we kept struggling with state management solutions and re-invented the wheel.\n\nThe good news is that now we have react-query. And even better - we have hooks, so combining server and client state is easier than ever.\n\nLet’s explore this new architecture based on react-query, together, and learn how we can benefit from its flexibility and simplicity.\n\nAdam Klein\nCo-founder & CTO @ Covver\nAdam is the CTO of Covver, a web GDE, and author of open source libraries.

        "description": "ReactNext \nwww.react-next.com\n Israel's Annual React & React Native conference \n@reactnext\n\nCreating production-ready infrastructure for your React app in 30 minutes or less\n\nWith so many different technologies, we have a strong tendency to overcomplicate our development process. It’s natural - after all, it stems from our need to deliver quickly despite the pressure. Unfortunately, this misguided approach significantly slows down development instead of speeding it up, delays delivery and causes us to waste valuable resources on trial and error.\n\nIn this talk we’ll demonstrate an applicable, streamlined approach for creating production-ready infrastructure to help your developers focus on code and business logic rather than wasting their time.\n\nWe will start from scratch, and write and deploy an application to production. Using React and a monorepo approach, we will learn how to spin up everything a startup needs to launch a hyperscale product.\n\nThis talk is designed for attendees who are early in their cloud native journey - you will walk out with more knowledge of production ready clusters, and greater comfort in product deployment.\n\nAlon Valadji\nAlon is a leading software architect well-versed in Rozansky and Woods’ architectural methodologies.

But over time the project grows and changes, and everything doesn't always stay up to date. Now you have a few cobwebs 🕸 on some parts of your codebase that you cringe 😅 at when you come across them!\n\nThis is a totally normal part of the natural growth of an application. But how can we tackle those smells and correct past mistakes without massively blowing out the scope 🤔?\n\nLet's discuss a generic approach to incrementally improve many aspects of our codebases! We will take some ideas from genetic algorithms and micro-service architectures, and combine them with code analysis and snapshot testing, and introduce a pragmatic, *evolutionary* approach to codebase health and maintenance.\n\nCraig Spence\nSenior Engineer @ Spotify \nCraig is a Software Engineer from New Zealand, working at Spotify in Stockholm.

        "description": "ReactNext \nwww.react-next.com \nIsrael's Annual React & React Native conference \n@reactnext\n\nHow We Introduced Automated Web App Testing in A Large Organization\n\nMany organizations struggle with building a reliable set of automated tests for their React web applications. Yet a set of manual test plans is not an answer; testing without automation is slow, gives low confidence in the software, and the test results provide little actionable feedback to the developers. Should we just write unit and component tests using Jest? You must be joking - these tests are definitely not enough to ensure the app works. In this presentation, I describe how a large company has built a comprehensive automated set of end-to-end and component test suites after two previous unsuccessful attempts. I will show how to build trust between the QA engineers and front-end developers, how to convince other stake holders that investing time in testing is important, and how to balance the different types of tests: e2e, component, unit, and api to cover both the happy paths and the edge cases.\n\nGleb Bahmotov\nVP of Engineering at Mercari\nGleb Bahmutov is JavaScript ninja, image processing expert and software quality fanatic.

In this talk, I'll introduce react-hook-form, a library that started to gain more and more popularity. It is super light, intuitive, performant, and flexible with easy-to-use validation. We'll cover its basics through a live code example and learn about its benefits compared to other popular libraries.\n\nKeren Kenzi\nSenior Software Engineer at AppsFlyer\n\nKeren is a front-end developer at AppsFlyer, who has been working as a software engineer for more than a decade.

There are tutorials everywhere to create almost every type of component, the dust has settled on the state management wars, and it finally looks like we can just focus on building our dashboards in peace.\nOr is it?\nThe world of React is actually changing completely. Components can run completely on the server, 3D React structures are fueling future VR/AR metaverses, Vite is pushing Webpack, modules are federated everywhere, and Remix is what happens when you’re busy writing useCounter hooks.\nIt's extremely exciting how diverse and multifaceted the current ecosystem is evolving, beyond just writing components. The importance of being “metastack” - understanding the larger picture - from accessibility, performance to module federation, SSR, and even web3 - is more critical than ever.\nIn this talk we’ll try to see a glimpse of these concepts. Let’s explore Postmodern React - the Essentials.\n\nLiad Yosef\nFrontend Architect at Duda\nLiad is the Lead Fronted Architect @ Duda. A web enthusiast for over a decade, he loves to code all things web, to build perfect user/developer experiences, and maybe even talk about it later if someone listens.

Developers in this space are also now some of the highest paid in the entire industry. Building decentralized apps is a paradigm shift that requires a different way of thinking than apps built with traditional centralized infrastructure, tooling, and services.\n\nAs a React developer, I initially had a hard time understanding this entirely new (to me) ecosystem, how everything fit together, and the mental model needed to understand and be a productive full stack developer in this space.\n\nIn this talk, I'll give a comprehensive overview of the space, how you can get started building these types of applications, and the entire tech stack broken apart then put back together to show how everything works.\n\n\nNader Dabit is an author and full stack developer currently exploring Web3.",

        "description": "ReactNext \nwww.react-next.com\n Israel's Annual React & React Native conference \n@reactnext\n\nFrontend Microservices: Unravelling Spaghetti Code\n\nBackend microservices have enabled large companies like Google, Facebook, and Wix to scale their development teams to thousands of developers, while still maintaining the agility of small startups. The secret? Modularity and code isolation that enable teams to develop and deploy microservices independently of one another.\n\nMicrofrontends are the realization of this in the frontend. While the backend has consensus on how to architect microservices, the frontend is still in the experimentation phase. In this talk, I will describe how Roundforest does microfrontends, in a way that translates microservices to a natural and logical frontend architecture that makes sense on the web.\n\nGil Tayar\nSenior Software Architect at Roundforest\n\n35 years of experience have not dulled the fascination Gil Tayar has with software development. His passion is distributed systems and figuring out how to scale development to big teams. Extreme modularity and testing are the main tools in his toolbelt, using them to combat the code spaghetti monster at companies like Wix, Applitools, and at his current job as software architect at Roundforest.\n\nIn his private life, he is a dad to two lovely kids (and a cat), an avid reader of Science Fiction, (he counts Samuel Delany, Robert Silverberg, and Robert Heinlein as favorites) and a passionate film buff. (Stanley Kubrick, Lars Von Trier, David Cronenberg, anybody?)\n\nUnfortunately for him, he hasn’t answered the big question of his life—what’s better, static or dynamic languages? But he’s working on it.",

        "description": "ReactNext\n www.react-next.com\n Israel's Annual React & React Native conference \n@reactnext\n\nReact problems, CSS solutions\n\nReact is amazing, it allows us to do incredible things, and the possibilities are endless. But with so many options, a component that seems very simple, can have all sorts of weird states and bizarre conditioning, and we can sometimes find ourselves struggling with our own code and hacking our way to the desired result. As a React developer, I run into these problems on a regular basis, but as a CSS specialist, I know that many of these problems have much simpler solutions.\n\nIn this talk I'll try to bring my knowledge and expertise in combining JavaScript and CSS, present some real-life everyday cases that React developers encounter, and demonstrate how they can be solved in a simpler way, using CSS.\n\nAmit Sheen\nSenior Front-end Developer at Payoneer\n\nAmit is an experienced web developer, doing mainly front-end, specializing in CSS, animations, and creative coding. Amit have a pathological curiosity about new technologies, and a constant desire to learn new things.",

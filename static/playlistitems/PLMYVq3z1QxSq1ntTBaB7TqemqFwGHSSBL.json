Rethinking Form Validations in React\n\nForms are at the backbone of the web, but building and validating them can be a tangled mess of code and frustration. As they get more complex, they become harder to write, maintain, and validate effectively.\nIntroducing a new way of validating forms in React, using Vest - a library that changes the way we handle form validation using the expressive syntax and style of testing libraries.\nWe will cover the history of forms on the web, why they are so hard to validate - and how to fix them. We'll step up our form validation game by taking a complex form, and together write its validations using Vest.\n\n\nEvyatar Alush\nFront End Engineer @ Meta\n\nEvyatar Alush is a Front End Engineer at Meta who is passionate about open source development.

The more it expands, the heavier it gets with larger bundle sizes, dependencies multiplying, and the overall complexity going through the roof. And let's face it, it's a headache when every project using the library ends up dragging the entire package, even when they just need a single component 🤦.\nBut worry not! That's where tree-shaking steps in to save the day!\nIn this talk, I will spill the beans on my experience fine-tuning a React component library that boasts over 40 components and serves various projects. We'll roll up our sleeves and dig into the world of tree shaking, talk about what you need to get it up and running smoothly and untangle some tricky terms like commonJS vs. ES modules, peer dependencies, and the whole multi-bundle exports thing.\nGet ready for some down-to-earth, practical insights that can save you a refactor or two.\n\n\nAsaf Shochet Avida\nFrontend Tech Lead @ Evinced\n\nAsaf is the front-end tech lead @Evinced, with 13+ years of experience under his belt, including frontend, backend, and test automation (go testing!), and a special place in his heart for shiny CI pipelines.\nHe loves reading Harry Potter with his daughter, mentoring junior devs, and making bonfires with his family.",

But all of them as well as other “current generation” frameworks have limitations.. In order to better prepare for what’s coming next as developers, let’s talk about the next challenges facing JS frameworks, learning from history and outlining how our future will look like.\n\nHaving spent the past few years building a next generation framework myself, I have lots of insights and a good perspective to share, as I’ve done a fair bit of research on the topic.\nWe’ll talk about Signals, Web Components, Qwik and a whole new way of thinking about traditional frameworks. So strap on the seatbelts… we’re getting in the delorean… back to the future!\n\n\nYoav Abrahami\nChief Architect & Head of coding products @Wix engineering.\n\nWorking at Wix for 14 years, a father of two kids, mountain biker & 30 years in tech.

I believe we aren’t.\nI aim to bring a vision that returns full circle to an ecosystem with little to no tooling. It shows that with modern technologies like import maps, web bundles, the type annotations proposal, 103 Early Hints, and others, we can bring back the simplicity of the early ecosystem, while not sacrificing the advantages of the current one.\nThis talk presents this vision, and describes the technologies and techniques that enable this return to simplicity.\n\n\nGil Tayar\nSenior Architect @ Microsoft\n\n35 years of experience have not dulled the fascination Gil Tayar has with software development. His passion is distributed systems and figuring out how to scale development to big teams. Extreme modularity and testing are the main tools in his toolbelt, using them to combat the code spaghetti monster as a software architect at companies like Wix, Applitools, and at his current job as software engineer at Microsoft.\nIn his private life, he is a dad to two lovely kids, an avid reader of Science Fiction, and a passionate film buff. Unfortunately for him, he hasn’t answered the big question of his life—what’s better, static or dynamic languages? But he’s working on it.",

What magic does it use to be so fast and responsive? How to write your own implementation and get better at writing such libraries? You’ve come to the right place!\nIn this talk, we are going to dive into how React Query works, how it handles caching, how it manages multiple requests at the same time without wasting network resources, and how it works cross-framework without needing to rewrite its core components.\nThis talk is intended for experienced developers and assumes that you’ve used React Query in the past, and are familiar with concepts such as custom hooks, pub-sub mechanism, React data-syncing patterns, and a little bit about caching and promises.\n\n\nEvyatar Daud\nSenior Full Stack Developer @ Elementor\n\nEvyatar Daud is a Senior Full-Stack Developer at Elementor.

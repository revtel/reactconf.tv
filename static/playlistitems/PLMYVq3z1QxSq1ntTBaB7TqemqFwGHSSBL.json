        "description": "ReactNext 2024\nIsrael's largest Frontend Conference\n\nwww.react-next.com\nBrought to you by EventHandler (www.eventhandler.co.il)\n\n\nAnimate All the Things! (With View Transitions API)\n\nGenerally speaking, animations kinda suck. They require complicated CSS and JavaScript fine-tuning, often involve state management, and can sometimes break at the slightest touch. They do make for a delightful user experience though, so they‚Äôre worth getting really good at\nThe View Transitions API provides us with a mechanism to manage animations in single page applications. This native API not only handles transitions, but effectively manages the DOM state change under the hood. And it‚Äôs customizable with some straightforward CSS.\nIn this talk we‚Äôll look at how to use the View Transitions API using a demo app, and also take a bit of a dive into how this works under the hood.\n\n\nNetta Bondy\nSenior Front End Developer\n\nNetta is a senior front end developer and a lover of all things JavaScript.

We did this by inlining constant objects directly into the referencing code, reducing the need for including huge files at the bundle output. We actually achieved better improvement than Webpack‚Äôs tree-shaking! This was allowed by harnessing the power of Babel‚Äôs AST tools: utilizing their potentials may yield dramatic results, unattainable by other manners.\nIn this sessions I will explain about:\n* What are ASTs and why are they useful\n* How to develop AST-based tools\n* Some limitations of tree-shaking\n* Strategies for writing custom bundler plugins\n* A secret tip for avoiding our mistake\nJoin us for a new outlook on ASTs with insights that might surprise you!\n\n\nOmri Lavi\nDevTools Tech Lead @ Monday\n\nWith over a decade of industry experience, I've been an engineer at monday.com for the past 2+ years as part of the DevTools group.

This method allows developers to write intuitive and linear business logic, akin to using if (await dialog(\"question\")) {...} for handling user inputs, streamlining the process of complex user flows and decision trees within applications.\n\n\nNoam Honig\nCreator of Remult\n\nCoder, open-sourcerer, developer experience enthusiast, software architect, and entrepreneur.

In this presentation, we challenge the conventional practice of purging old code. We will explore how our team's seemingly counterintuitive decision to stop deleting old codepaths has not only streamlined our React development process but has also acted as an unforeseen safety net in times of crisis. In other words, our laziness became a wellspring of real-time resilience.\nJoin this session to explore how an embrace of relics in the code can enhance resilience, expedite recovery, and provide unexpected solutions to the challenges faced by front-end developers using the React framework. Gain insights into how this unorthodox strategy not only provides unexpected solutions, but also transforms old code flows from a perceived liability into an invaluable asset.\n\nNoam Tahor Shafran\nEngineering Manager @ Remitly \n\nNoam began her journey with Remitly 4.5 years ago as a junior front-end developer and quickly evolved professionally. Today, she leads a team of full-stack developers in charge of the Rewire by Remitly financial platform. With a BSc in Computer Science from Tel Aviv-Yafo Academic College, prior to joining Rewire (now Remitly Israel), Noam gained professional experience from leading tech companies such as Check Point.\nOutside of work, Noam raises her three year old daughter together with her partner and her goal is to effectively manage these two worlds in a way that leads to further growth and development.\n\nTom Carpel\nDirector of Engineering @ Remitly \n\nTom has over 15 years of software development and engineering management experience. With a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from UCLA under his belt, Tom‚Äôs career includes working at some of the biggest companies in the San Francisco Bay Area such as Box and Cisco. Upon his return to Israel, Tom started working at the fintech startup Rewire (now Remitly Israel). When not working, Tom likes to walk (his dog) and run (for fun and occasionally in a marathon).",

Rethinking Form Validations in React\n\nForms are at the backbone of the web, but building and validating them can be a tangled mess of code and frustration. As they get more complex, they become harder to write, maintain, and validate effectively.\nIntroducing a new way of validating forms in React, using Vest - a library that changes the way we handle form validation using the expressive syntax and style of testing libraries.\nWe will cover the history of forms on the web, why they are so hard to validate - and how to fix them. We'll step up our form validation game by taking a complex form, and together write its validations using Vest.\n\n\nEvyatar Alush\nFront End Engineer @ Meta\n\nEvyatar Alush is a Front End Engineer at Meta who is passionate about open source development.

The more it expands, the heavier it gets with larger bundle sizes, dependencies multiplying, and the overall complexity going through the roof. And let's face it, it's a headache when every project using the library ends up dragging the entire package, even when they just need a single component ü§¶.\nBut worry not! That's where tree-shaking steps in to save the day!\nIn this talk, I will spill the beans on my experience fine-tuning a React component library that boasts over 40 components and serves various projects. We'll roll up our sleeves and dig into the world of tree shaking, talk about what you need to get it up and running smoothly and untangle some tricky terms like commonJS vs. ES modules, peer dependencies, and the whole multi-bundle exports thing.\nGet ready for some down-to-earth, practical insights that can save you a refactor or two.\n\n\nAsaf Shochet Avida\nFrontend Tech Lead @ Evinced\n\nAsaf is the front-end tech lead @Evinced, with 13+ years of experience under his belt, including frontend, backend, and test automation (go testing!), and a special place in his heart for shiny CI pipelines.\nHe loves reading Harry Potter with his daughter, mentoring junior devs, and making bonfires with his family.",

But all of them as well as other ‚Äúcurrent generation‚Äù frameworks have limitations.. In order to better prepare for what‚Äôs coming next as developers, let‚Äôs talk about the next challenges facing JS frameworks, learning from history and outlining how our future will look like.\n\nHaving spent the past few years building a next generation framework myself, I have lots of insights and a good perspective to share, as I‚Äôve done a fair bit of research on the topic.\nWe‚Äôll talk about Signals, Web Components, Qwik and a whole new way of thinking about traditional frameworks. So strap on the seatbelts‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre getting in the delorean‚Ä¶ back to the future!\n\n\nYoav Abrahami\nChief Architect & Head of coding products @Wix engineering.\n\nWorking at Wix for 14 years, a father of two kids, mountain biker & 30 years in tech.

I believe we aren‚Äôt.\nI aim to bring a vision that returns full circle to an ecosystem with little to no tooling. It shows that with modern technologies like import maps, web bundles, the type annotations proposal, 103 Early Hints, and others, we can bring back the simplicity of the early ecosystem, while not sacrificing the advantages of the current one.\nThis talk presents this vision, and describes the technologies and techniques that enable this return to simplicity.\n\n\nGil Tayar\nSenior Architect @ Microsoft\n\n35 years of experience have not dulled the fascination Gil Tayar has with software development. His passion is distributed systems and figuring out how to scale development to big teams. Extreme modularity and testing are the main tools in his toolbelt, using them to combat the code spaghetti monster as a software architect at companies like Wix, Applitools, and at his current job as software engineer at Microsoft.\nIn his private life, he is a dad to two lovely kids, an avid reader of Science Fiction, and a passionate film buff. Unfortunately for him, he hasn‚Äôt answered the big question of his life‚Äîwhat‚Äôs better, static or dynamic languages? But he‚Äôs working on it.",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nWhile developing mobile applications we usually have a mental model of a single runnable piece of software that includes all features and there’s a good reason for that - it’s difficult to split functionality in native mobile applications. However, with React Native most of our logic lives as a JavaScript, which can be splitted. The web development community has been doing that for years. So what if we could split our React Native code using the power of Webpack?\n\nPaweł Trysła aka. Zamotany is a software engineer at Callstack and the lead engineer at Re.Pack. Paweł calls himself “the tooling guy” with extensive knowledge of Webpack and Babel. He is also a huge fan of Electron, functional programming and RxJS.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_zamotany \n\nGithub: https://github.com/zamotany",

Is it easy to create another Skype or Whatsapp? \nThis talk will walk you through the various aspects of creating \"the calling app\". Starting with what the VoIP actually is, going through some theory of WebRTC connections, and ending with the CallKit of iOS vs Android way of handling calls with the React Native. It will give you a sneak peek of what is required to make a production app that handles outgoing and incoming calls and what kind of infrastructure you need. The talk is based on the experience taken from the phone app made for sales and support teams around the world.\n\nWojciech is a JavaScript developer, trainer, and mentor. Started commercial programming with Node.js, then switched to front end world to work with mobile lastly. During the past few years went through many JS frameworks and companies building different pieces of software. For many years involved in JavaScript trainings by preparing materials and leading both open-source and commercial workshops. Now bridging the gap between tech and business.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/WojciechKwiatek\nGithub: https://github.com/wkwiatek\n\nAdditional Links:\n\nLink to slides: https://www.slideshare.net/WojciechKwiatek3/react-native-eu-2021-creating-a-voip-app-in-react-native-the-beginners-guide\n\nLink to the main React Native packages mentioned in the talk:\n- React Native WebRTC: https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc\n- React Native CallKeep: https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nThis talk is targeted developers creating apps for a Bluetooth device, such as a loudspeaker, a toothbrush or a dishwasher. I report on my experience using the technique of \"mock recording\" to get very fast and robust integration tests. \n\nIn collaboration with SOUNDBOKS, a Bluetooth speaker company, I have developed an open source tool for creating and using recordings of Bluetooth (BLE) traffic to test a React Native app using Jest. The tool makes it possible to run several integration tests per second as opposed to several minutes per end-to-end test. The tool is based on years of production experience using mock recording for web traffic. \n\nIn this talk I introduce the methodology, perform a live demonstration of the tool, and report on our experience using the tool during app development: how is the quality and speed of feedback from these tests, and how easy is the tool to use for developers? \n\nThe tool is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ble-plx-mock-recorder.\n\n\nLars is an experienced software developer, architect and coach. Lars is an expert in fast and robust test automation with a track record of successfully running 200+ integration tests per second. Currently Lars focuses on web and mobile development with React and React Native.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/larsthorup\n\nGithub: https://github.com/larsthorup\n\nAdditional Links:\nLink to slides: https://www.fullstackagile.eu/2021/09/02/react-native-bluetooth-ble-mock-recording/",

So I'm back again, this time with React Navigation 6. In this talk, I'll go through some highlights of React Navigation 6 and how it improves the DX, and discuss the reasons behind a major version bump.\n\nSatya is a maintainer of React Navigation who has been contributing to React Navigation from almost the beginning, and lead the work behind React Navigation 5.

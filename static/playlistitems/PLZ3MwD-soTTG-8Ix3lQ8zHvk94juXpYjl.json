        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nWhile developing mobile applications we usually have a mental model of a single runnable piece of software that includes all features and there’s a good reason for that - it’s difficult to split functionality in native mobile applications. However, with React Native most of our logic lives as a JavaScript, which can be splitted. The web development community has been doing that for years. So what if we could split our React Native code using the power of Webpack?\n\nPaweł Trysła aka. Zamotany is a software engineer at Callstack and the lead engineer at Re.Pack. Paweł calls himself “the tooling guy” with extensive knowledge of Webpack and Babel. He is also a huge fan of Electron, functional programming and RxJS.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/_zamotany \n\nGithub: https://github.com/zamotany",

Is it easy to create another Skype or Whatsapp? \nThis talk will walk you through the various aspects of creating \"the calling app\". Starting with what the VoIP actually is, going through some theory of WebRTC connections, and ending with the CallKit of iOS vs Android way of handling calls with the React Native. It will give you a sneak peek of what is required to make a production app that handles outgoing and incoming calls and what kind of infrastructure you need. The talk is based on the experience taken from the phone app made for sales and support teams around the world.\n\nWojciech is a JavaScript developer, trainer, and mentor. Started commercial programming with Node.js, then switched to front end world to work with mobile lastly. During the past few years went through many JS frameworks and companies building different pieces of software. For many years involved in JavaScript trainings by preparing materials and leading both open-source and commercial workshops.

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nThis talk is targeted developers creating apps for a Bluetooth device, such as a loudspeaker, a toothbrush or a dishwasher. I report on my experience using the technique of \"mock recording\" to get very fast and robust integration tests. \n\nIn collaboration with SOUNDBOKS, a Bluetooth speaker company, I have developed an open source tool for creating and using recordings of Bluetooth (BLE) traffic to test a React Native app using Jest. The tool makes it possible to run several integration tests per second as opposed to several minutes per end-to-end test. The tool is based on years of production experience using mock recording for web traffic. \n\nIn this talk I introduce the methodology, perform a live demonstration of the tool, and report on our experience using the tool during app development: how is the quality and speed of feedback from these tests, and how easy is the tool to use for developers? \n\nThe tool is available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ble-plx-mock-recorder.\n\n\nLars is an experienced software developer, architect and coach. Lars is an expert in fast and robust test automation with a track record of successfully running 200+ integration tests per second. Currently Lars focuses on web and mobile development with React and React Native.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/larsthorup\n\nGithub: https://github.com/larsthorup\n\nAdditional Links:\nLink to slides: https://www.fullstackagile.eu/2021/09/02/react-native-bluetooth-ble-mock-recording/",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nAccessibility shouldn't be a choice that developers should make. It should go without asking. Syncing states, adding the support of screen readers and keyboard interactions can be cumbersome. My team and I have built a set of React hooks that make it easy to build accessible React Native and Web components that complies with the WAI-ARIA standards. It's an adoption of React Aria (by Adobe) in React Native for mobile platforms. The web support is also enabled using React Native Web to make universal components that are accessible by default on all the platforms. We call it React Native Aria. Let's talk about it!\n\nAbout the speaker:\nSanket is the founder of GeekyAnts - a Design and Development studio that is the team behind popular Open Source projects such as NativeBase, BuilderX, SyncState, and others.\nHe is on a mission to empower everyone to build things and has spoken at conferences such as ReactNative EU, React Europe, ReactDay Bangalore, and others.\nFun fact - he is also amazing at playing the guitar and has a studio at home!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sanketsahu\nGithub: https://github.com/sanketsahusoft\n\nAdditional links:\nSlides:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12iQiDhRIfhfCMS5nlZM6CRD2SxDto74V/view?usp=sharing",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nAnimation is a crucial element of modern mobile UI development. The JS-to-Native bridge that makes React Native so great also has implications for animation, since declarative and performant animations should be declared on one side of the bridge and executed on the other while making as few trips across the bridge as possible.\nIn this talk, I'll introduce an animation tool, React Native Reanimated 2, and how it helps simplify this mental model for performant animations while providing power-user tools for complex animations. I'll provide some real-world use-cases for Reanimated 2, and how it can fit into your React Native workflow even if you're not an animation expert.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nI am a software engineer that loves using JS to make cool things. I am focused primarily on mobile app development work with React Native, but I also try to stay up to date with the happenings in the web front-end space. I have a formal background in mathematics and education which has led to a soft spot for mobile UX and animation.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gksander93\nGithub: https://github.com/gksander\n\nAdditional links:\nSlides and demo materials from the talk:\nhttps://github.com/gksander/rn-eu-2021-reanimated.",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:\nA year ago, I challenged myself to practice TDD on my React Native application all the time for two weeks.\n\nAt first, I was afraid, then I was petrified. \nI kept thinking I could never write tests that my code would abide. \nBut then I spent so many nights thinking about what testing is and how I was doing it wrong. \nAnd I grew strong. \n\nI became more confident writing tests with React Native Testing Library. After two weeks I realized that it was one of the best decisions I had ever made. One year later I would never go back, and I believe a lot of developers would benefit from it as well. \n\nIn this talk I am going to cover:\n- a quick reminder of what TDD is\n- how to use 100% TDD (yes, even with components!) on a React Native app by developing a HackerNews clone in RN\n- why switching to TDD made me a lot faster\n- why TDD made my code healthier\n- in which conditions I would recommend not using TDD\n\nMy goal is to lower the barrier to start using TDD with React Native and to convince other developers to give it a try!\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\"Louis Zawadzki has been developing React Native apps of different sizes and shapes since 2017. \nHe became a developer after he heard that \"a server is like a computer, but without a mouse nor a screen,\" and was intrigued to know what kind of superpowers developers had to do something with no mouse and no screen.\n\n\"Life is too short to click on simulators\" could be his motto, hence his love for TDD and building easily changeable and testable architectures.\n\nHe is also passionate about many things such as German rock music from the 70s, storefront typography and fig rolls.\"\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zawadzkil\nGithub: https://github.com/louiszawadzki\n\nAdditional links:\n\"A catalog of TDD recipes for React Native: https://louiszawadzki.github.io/react-native-tdd/\n\nAn article I wrote about how TDD had such an impact on my career: https://blog.bam.tech/developer-news/software-development-learning-path\"",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract: \nMost of the people watching this talk have some sort of connection to React-Native, either by playing around with it or by doing it professionally. This talk will show alternative approach on how to build React-Native apps which you might not have tried before or even though of.  My story started two years ago, together with a friend we made an app to scratch our own itch, we wanted to listen to more podcasts. One of the things we tried was to listen to podcast while working out, which works fine when you go slow or rest between sets, but when you're going at it, it's hard to focus on the podcast or if you focus on the podcast you can get injured (I once started laughing from podcast in the middle of a squat rep, I do not recommend that 😅). Our solution was to create an app that plays music when you go at it and plays podcast when you rest or go slow - combined with a workout timer.\n\nThe interesting part here is that both playing music and podcast is done using native iOS and Android code. Together with playing audio we also have to run the workout timer on the native thread so if the app is put to background the timer still runs. The way we started architecture this app was to have a control center on the javascript side that emits events to the native side when its time to play music and when its time to play podcast, as well as an event listing to the timer running on the native thread. \n\nEmitting events back and fourth over the bridge just to keep the native and the javascript in sync is not sufficient and error prone. So we did what any sane developer would do, we did a re-write! We moved all the logic from the control center to the native side and we also moved the counter UI to the native side.\n\nIn this talk I will go through how we did it from an Android perspective and I hope you might think of ways to optimise your app by levering the native side 🤞🏼\n\nSpeaker bio: \nBeen building software products for the last 10 years. I've been shipping more than five different apps using React-Native and I have been part of teams maintaining several React-Native apps for years.

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract: Going from web to mobile? Starting with React Native comes naturally for React developers, but there are some significant differences because mobile development is a totally different adventure. In this talk, I'd like to go over the challenges you'll experience in your journey from React to React Native apps. I'll offer my own experience as a React developer on how to get started building mobile apps and a new perspective showing that the mobile world is quite different from the web. I want to share all the differences, challenges, and advantages to keep in mind when diving into the native apps universe.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nSoftware Engineer living and working in Serbia. Tech Lead in Badin Soft with experience working on React and React Native apps. Loves teaching and mentoring, and considers it a work of heart. Supporting women who code and inspiring girls in their path to become successful developers.\n\nI have been more active on Instagram where I share my knowledge in React, React Native, and JS generally so here is links for Instagram and Twitter to check it out:  \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/millicode_/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/millicode_",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract: Most apps on your phone send user notifications; they are straightforward to integrate and apply to the most basic of use cases. However, most of these apps aren’t exploiting their full power to increase user engagement and retention.\n\nThere are two types of notifications used to inform users, local and remote (aka push). For example, a messaging app might let the user know when a new message has arrived, or a calendar app might inform the user of a scheduled appointment. \n\nIn this talk, we’ll walk through how to integrate local notifications in a React Native app and demonstrate how they can be elevated beyond the basic title and body, to enhance the overall user experience.\n\n- Getting set up with Notifee\n- Media support\n- Quick Actions\n- Scheduling using Trigger Notifications\n\nBio: Helena is the CTO of StackTiger and has been building and shipping React Native apps since it was first released.  She is a maintainer of Notifee, a library for creating local notifications, and is somewhat of a Firebase Messaging expert. When she’s not killing her Macbook processor, she likes to read, binge YouTube, and cook up new plant-based recipes. \n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/helenaellieford",

        "description": "This talk was presented during the React Native EU 2021 - the largest community conference in the world focused exclusively on React Native.\n\nAbstract:You've got an idea for an app and you've thought through how you'll build it. Now it's time to make your idea a reality. Along your development journey, you'll almost certainly run into complexities when configuring your project, sharing it with your team, submitting it to the app stores, and keeping it updated over time. In this talk, you'll learn how to take your idea from back-of-the-napkin notes to a full-fledged app store app using open source tools and services from Expo. \nBio:\nJon Samp is a software developer and designer at Expo. In 2019, Jon built a React Native app named Codecademy Go, which was featured as Apple's App Store App of the Day. Jon enjoys making pour-over coffee, distance running, and hanging out with his partner and their two pets.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jonsamp\nGithub: https://github.com/jonsamp",

I will be talking about the journey of shipping the new Fabric renderer fully in the Facebook app; challenges we faced along the way; and how we overcame them. This talk will be less about Fabric itself (the “what”) and more about our experiences of using it at scale and migrating a very large codebase to using exclusively Fabric (the “how”), and what we learned along the way.\n\nBio:Joshua Gross (he/him) is a software engineer on the React Native core team at Facebook. For the past few years, Josh has been focused on the new renderer (Fabric) rollout within Facebook. Outside of React Native, Josh enjoys being over-caffeinated, eating spicy food, and supporting the lavish lifestyles of two rescue dogs.\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/joshuaisgross",

Each solution has its advantages and disadvantages. In this talk, you will get to know Animated, Reanimated 2, and Lottie, each solution with detailed code examples and recommended use cases for this solution. We will animate Image list headers with scale, translate and change opacity using Animated, change the height, position, and opacity onScroll using Reanimated 2 and use code-controlled Lottie-Animations to animate characters. You will not only learn how to create such beautiful animations but also how to do it that they run at 60fps on every device. \n\nABout the speaker:\nAlexander is the owner of Horizon Alpha. He loves working on awesome React Native apps and the corresponding cloud-based backends.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AlexanderKuttig",

What about snapshot testing? What should be our code coverage? Those are questions we often hear when discussing testing. Those questions are easy to discuss but the answers won‚Äôt necessarily make us write more reliable and flexible code. Many developers struggle to write tests 1) quickly and 2) that increase their degree of confidence. Writing good tests requires writing good code. Writing good code that is easy to test requires a good understanding of programming principles and how they apply to the libraries of choice. Discussing principles is harder than discussing tools. In this talk, we‚Äôll discuss the principles that will make developers increase their test confidence when building React apps. I‚Äôll also use those principles to challenge some believes that the audience might have about certain testing libraries or methodologies.\n\nAlex Lobera\nFounder at React GraphQL Academy and LeanJS.

Are they sometimes useful but come with a high maintenance cost? Do you secretly believe you‚Äôd work faster without them there? A great test suite should help speed up your development process, not slow you down. This talk highlights some techniques you can use to improve the front-end unit tests you write.\n\n¬†\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

We'll examine what makes the perfect test, what to avoid, and how to use more complex features like mocks and spies to enable you to write tests more easily. We'll also look at some of the common pitfalls and mistakes people make that can really begin to hurt you as your test suite grows.\n\nAbout Jack\n\nJack is a Frontend Engineer at Thread in London working primarily with React.

        "description": "Talk recording from React Advanced Meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Advanced/events/268458369/\n\n# Fast and robust visual unit tests for your React application\nby Dzianis Artsiukhovich\n\nDuring this talk, we‚Äôll consider different techniques of UI testing.\nDiscuss the difference and pros/cons of various approaches of UI testing, such as plugins for e2e tests, visual testing with storybook, their challenges.\n\nAnd then discover how to implement such tests on unit/integration level, which means without server at all and based on SSR. You‚Äôll see why and how we use visual unit tests at DAZN. Then you‚Äôll learn how to implement such tests from scratch step by step based on small React application. We‚Äôll also talk about the performance of such tests and about the integration into a pipeline.\n\nAbout Dzianis\n\nSenior Software Engineer and active open source contributor. From Minsk, but now based in London and work at DAZN. I like playing around with TS, React, Redux, MobX/MST, RxJS, WebGL, Serverless, Node, Functional Programming with a focus on performance, system architecture and team productivity.\n\n¬†\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

        "description": "Video recording from February 2019 meetup https://www.meetup.com/React-Amsterdam/events/257858463/\n\nTesting is considered as standard practice in our industry. We use libraries to mock dependencies to test our code in isolation (e.g. services used in our React components). We take them for granted, assuming that they function correctly, probably by magic! Are mocking libraries ‚Äúmagic‚Äù?\n\nJoin Mattia to find out what libraries, such as Jest, are doing under the hood as you write your own mock testing library.\n\nAbout Mattia\nHe loves shell scripting; he literally lives in the terminal (that‚Äôs probably why he uses VIM). Other than getting his hands dirty with React, RxJS and Mobx, he is also passionate about cyber security and Motorbikes.\n\n¬†\nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

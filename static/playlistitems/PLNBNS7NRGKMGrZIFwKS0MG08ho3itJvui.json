In his talk, Aleksandr will show a tool and ideas behind it that helped Contentful to facilitate migration, gave better visibility and changed his team's habits.\n\nAbout Alex (https://github.com/suevalov)\n\nAlex is a frontend developer and frontend chapter lead at Contentful. He is passionate about the performance and maintainability of systems, simplifying processes, and getting things done. Previously worked for Opera and DataArt.

        "description": "ReactNext 2025\nwww.react-next.com\nBrought to you by EventHandler (www.eventhandler.co.il)\n\nWe all know caching can speed up our apps - but most developers think of CacheStorage as a tool for storing assets like images, scripts, and stylesheets. What if I told you that the real power of CacheStorage lies in API response caching?\n\nBy intelligently storing and serving HTTP responses directly from the browser, we can significantly reduce server load, eliminate redundant network requests, and deliver near-instant data retrieval - all while keeping the cache fresh and up to date. This means faster page loads, better offline support, and a smoother user experience without sacrificing real-time data accuracy.\n\nAfter implementing this approach in three different companies - and seeing firsthand how it dramatically improved load times, reduced backend strain, and made the app feel instantly responsive - I want to share the key strategies that make it work.\n\nWhat You’ll Take Away:\n✅ How CacheStorage API works and why it’s better than LocalStorage or IndexedDB for API caching\n✅ How to cache API responses and serve data instantly without hitting the network\n✅ Smart strategies for cache invalidation, versioning, and dynamic updates\n✅ How to integrate CacheStorage with React Query / SWR for even better performance\n✅ Real-world examples of how caching API responses can make your app feel native-fast\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with slow API responses or unnecessary network calls, this talk will show you how to take control of caching and make your React app feel lightning-fast.\n\nI'm a Full Stack Team Lead at Harmonya, where I lead the development of scalable, high-performance applications with a strong focus on JavaScript. I joined Harmonya after playing a key role at CyberSixgill, contributing to its successful exit, and after serving in 8200 in both mandatory and professional service.

        "description": "ReactNext 2025\nwww.react-next.com\nBrought to you by EventHandler (www.eventhandler.co.il)\n\nNavigating large-scale changes in a codebase can be daunting—hundreds of files, numerous breaking changes, and the ever-present risk of human error. But what if you could automate this process and transform it from a nightmare into a seamless operation?\n\nIn this session, we'll dive into the world of codemods and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), powerful techniques that enable precise and efficient code transformations. Through a compelling real-world case study, I'll showcase how we tackled a major version upgrade involving 70 breaking API changes in a large React project—and completed the migration in just 3 whopping minutes (!), but the benefits of codemods extend beyond major upgrades. They can revolutionize your day-to-day development by automating repetitive tasks and ensuring code consistency at scale. By the end of this talk, you'll walk away with practical insights and tools to integrate codemods into your workflow, making large-scale changes faster, safer, and more reliable.\n\nShahar Zilberman is the Team Lead of the Vibe design system at monday.com, where she leads the development of the company’s design system and UI tools. She has seven years of experience in engineering, has worked on front-end infrastructure and foundations at both monday.com and eToro, building scalable systems and internal tools for developers, and her team maintains multiple open-source libraries used by the developer community at large. In addition to her work in engineering, she spent a year mentoring aspiring developers in a bootcamp, helping them transition into professional roles.\nIn her spare time, Shahar is a devoted Maccabi Tel Aviv fan and an animal lover with two very fluffy dogs.",

But those same tools — localStorage, cookies, sessionStorage, and friends — can open the door to real-world security breaches.\n\nThis talk exposes the hidden risks of client-side storage through real examples of how attackers (and sometimes just curious users) took advantage of sloppy storage handling to hijack apps, steal data, and bend logic in unexpected ways.\n\nNo advanced skills required. Sometimes, all it takes is DevTools and a spare minute.\nAnd with AI becoming part of our frontends — the attack surface is only growing.\n\nBy the end, you’ll probably rush to check what your app is leaving behind in your users’ browsers.\n\nHila Kraisler is a Principal Software Engineer and Front-End Tech Lead at CyberArk.\nShe has over a decade of experience in front-end development and is passionate about mentoring and knowledge sharing.\nShe writes technical blog posts and actively supports women in tech.

        "description": "ReactNext 2025\nwww.react-next.com\nBrought to you by EventHandler (www.eventhandler.co.il)\n\nA major shift is taking place in frontend programming that is mostly going unnoticed: the comeback of RPC (Remote Procedure Call). Leading frameworks, such as React, Qwik and Solid are embracing RPC as the preferred mechanism for accessing backend services and data from the frontend in the form of server components, server actions, and server functions. This is surprising because RPC used to be big in the 90s but fell out of favor when the Web took off, replaced by protocols such as REST and GraphQL. Now RPC is back and replacing these protocols instead. What’s driving this resurgence? Why is it happening now? What’s its impact on the way we implement frontends? In this talk I will answer these questions and explain how to achieve the benefits of RPC, avoid its limitations and make the most from this technological comeback.\n\nDan Shappir is Principal Engineer at Sisense. Previously he was Performance Tech Lead at NEXT Insurance and at Wix. Dan has over 25 years of software development experience, and has worked on systems ranging from multiuser games to missile trajectory simulations to designing and building very large scale Web applications.

But don’t worry - you didn’t sabotage it all at once. You’re not in this alone though. To crack this case, we’ve invited some of the world’s greatest detectives to help uncover the culprits behind your app’s sluggish behavior.\nReact makes it all too easy to unknowingly sabotage performance, with sneaky pitfalls like over-rendered components, re-created references, and sneaky state updates lurking in your code. These issues are elusive and often invisible to the untrained eye - until your app grinds to a halt.\nIn this session, you’ll think like a detective, learning how to spot red flags, interrogate your codebase, and identify common causes of performance woes.

        "description": "ReactNext 2025\nwww.react-next.com\nBrought to you by EventHandler (www.eventhandler.co.il)\n\nStop coding CSS like a developer—the key to scalable CSS architecture is thinking like a designer!\n\nCSS architecture involves naming conventions, design patterns, and organization strategies that make CSS scalable and maintainable. Many developers mistakenly think that writing good CSS depends on the latest trendy framework, but the reality is much simpler. The key to maintaining CSS effectively—especially as teams grow—is leveraging design tokens.\nWhen design tokens are done correctly, you can achieve a better look and feel, seamless theming and white-labeling support, improved accessibility and responsiveness, and most importantly: implementations that actually match the original design with minimal friction.\n\nIn this session, I will cover:\n- What design tokens are and how they can improve your UI, including responsiveness, accessibility, theme support, and more.\n- Why shifting to a designer’s mindset helps implement more scalable CSS and, in turn, more maintainable components.\n- Examples from industry leaders design systems like IBM, Shopify, and monday.com on how they use design tokens in their CSS codebases\n- A take-home checklist for adopting the high-level concepts discussed into practical do’s and don’ts for your CSS codebase.\n\nOver the past 10 years, I’ve worked on frontend infrastructure teams at various companies—from Elbit Systems during my military service to being part of the founding team that developed Vibe, monday.com’s design system, and leading frontend development at Ownera, a fintech startup.\n\nRecently, I took a leap of faith and decided to chase my dream: starting my own Front-End consulting business.\nMy goal is to help organizations transform their UI infrastructure, creating a better frontend codebase to enhance user experience, scalability, and product consistency.\n\nI’m passionate about discussing the frameworks and tools that empower Front-End and Full-Stack developers to build scalable UIs—from design systems and CSS best practices to component testing.",

These metaframeworks provide a layer of abstraction that aims at improving both DX and UX at the same time.\nThis abstraction is so good, maybe even too good. These days React devs can easily find themselves asking questions like \"where does my code run?\" or \"in what order does my code run?\".\nIn this talk we're not going to discuss a specific framework like Next.js or Tanstack Router- instead we're going to focus on React and React only.\nThe purpose of this talk is to walk through the small details to the big picture. From going under React’s hood- how do SSR and CSR really work, what HTTP limitations do we face, what are the common pitfalls and misconceptions.\nTo the big picture- WHY is React heading in this direction.\n\n\nMy stack includes TypeScript, React, Nextjs, Nestjs, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, FastAPI.\nI'm very passionate about public speaking, designing for scalability, graph theory, and understanding how do things work.",

        "description": "Abstract:\nA lot is changing in the core of React Native. We’ve got Fabric, TurboModules, JSI, etc. We’ve also been working on how these systems interact with the JavaScript in React Native apps. This talk will be a deep dive into some of the expected JavaScript API changes, React Native’s JS internals, new startup performance improvements, codegen, and more!\n\nEli White is a Software Engineer on the React Native core team at Facebook. Eli can live on ice cream, but thrives on pie.",

        "description": "Abstract:\nReact Native proves the success of running React other than browsers. The official supported frameworks from Facebook are only iOS and Android. There were some other platforms maintained by third-party developers, but these forks sometimes run with older React Native versions. The main reason is the difficulty to follow rapidly changed upstream code. From the upcoming React Native new architecture, there will be more platform-independent shared implementations and more abstraction layers. Let's see if we could extend React Native to some new platforms benefiting from the new architecture.",

Previously, Ram had written and spoken about adding instrumentation to understand the performance characteristics of the app.\nAs the next step, he will explore the various optimizations that can be done in this talk. He will focus on the Javascript section, something where there are many more low hanging fruits to optimizie.\nStarting from React Dev Tools, he will look at how developers can leverage their existing knowledge of web performance to attack mobile perf. He will talk about understanding SysTrace and Sampling Profilers. He will also debunk common myths like the problems with measuring app performance using Chrome JS profiler, debug versions of the app, etc. \nIn this talk, he will plan to outline a holistic approach that can be used to dive deeper into React Native performance.",

        "description": "Abstract:\nIn the past 5 years, the Wix mobile app has gone through quite a bit - a brand new look was launched, a large number of features were added in a short period of time, and the number of our users tripled. Unfortunately, one implication of product growth, is a slower performance, especially when it came to things like seamless transition, fluent animations and general slickness of the app. \n\nOver the past year, we made a tremendous effort to improve these regressions. Our ongoing efforts have so far resulted in almost 60% cumulative improvement in all performance metrics.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll deep into all of our secret ingredients for better performance in React Native applications, together with practical examples of:\n-Improving startup time\n-Responsive gestures \n-Preload prioritization\nFurthermore, I’ll outline some general work we’ve done that led us to these improvements, like the right way to measure and analyse your app performance on production, and how you can implement these tips and tricks.",

I'll take you to quick introduction to Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Fundamentals of ARKit for iOS which is one of biggest AR platform and ARcore for Android. Will use Viro React to do live coding and build an experience like never before for audience. My target for this talk is to make React Native devs familiarised with this world of AR/VR so that they take advantage of this new skill by going through practical example and see for themselves how easy it is with React Native.",

Rendering in memory is cheap and fast compared to runtime environment, so in-memory UI testing libraries emerged. One of the most popular one now is React Testing Library. Soon after it went public, React Native Testing Library was created trying to implement their style of testing for React Native components. And a few months later another one came to light out of the blue, quickly becoming an official one. The community ended up with two almost identical libraries. Sounds confusing, huh? It was! This story is about all this drama, how it eventually turned out, how community and empathy wins, how businesses help sustain OSS, sprinkled with examples of how you can test your React Native components with just JavaScript.",

We are running a three week release cycle with new A/B tests and new features in every release. The application has 99.8% sessions without crashes and a 4.6/4.7 star rating on the AppStores. All that is achieved with only two developers. \nI want to share some insights on how we are able to make this possible. We are able to focus most of the time on developing by automating all tasks which we are able to automate and have clear processes wherever possible. The talk will focus a lot on how to specifically automate task in the ReactNative environment.\nSome examples of things we automated:\n- PR quality checks - Unit testing (Jest) + Code styling (ESlint) + Typechecking\n- End user testing on real devices (AWS Device Farm + Appium)\n- Testing Builds + Shipment to customer\n- Production Builds + Shipment to stores\n- Integration of translation systems\n- Generation of sourcemaps and shipment to bug tracking system",

        "description": "Abstract:\nFeature flags allow development teams to separate code deployment from feature release. It has grown to be an essential tool for testing in production, A/B testing, and controlled rollout. Controlled rollout using feature flags is a way to deliver features to your users safely, but doing it on mobile comes with some challenges. How do you propagate feature flagging configuration to mobile devices that don’t always have a strong network? As a mobile developer, you want to be able to use the latest flag configuration, but you also don’t want to stop someone using the app just because you can’t load the feature flag config. \n\nIn this talk, we'll start with why controlled rollout is important and how feature flags enable you to do it successfully, then we will talk about mobile specifics, and then a demo with React Native.",

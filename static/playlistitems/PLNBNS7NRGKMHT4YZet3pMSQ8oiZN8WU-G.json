        "title": "Parallel computing in ReactJS: Provide a pleasant user experience - Majid Hajian",
        "description": "Talk recording from React Day Berlin Conference 2019\n  \nCheck out the latest React Day Berlin news – https://reactday.berlin\n\nSee other React conferences by GitNation\nReact Summit Amsterdam – https://reactsummit.com\nReact Advanced London – https://reactadvanced.com\n\n# Parallel computing in ReactJS\nUser is working with your application, suddenly, UI freezes and probably, one of the CPU cores is burning! They cannot do anything. The only perception you can feel is as hot as a hell metal case of the laptop. Although this sounds like a horror movie, this is your application that cannot leverage modern APIs to lift heavy computation to a different thread where consequently user suffers the pain.\n\nModern features like Web Workers, WebAssembly, Worklets, and Service Worker allow us to leverage multithreading computing to run tasks parallelly which at the end, makes the user feel like in a rainbow paradise instead of a nightmare, even though JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language!\n\nIn this session, Majid shows his experience running jobs in parallel on a React.js application that will provide a pleasant user experience and exciting development.\n\nMajid Hajian\nMajid Hajian is a passionate software developer with years of developing and architecting complex web and mobile applications. He is passionate about web platform especially flutter, IoT, PWAs, and performance. He loves sharing his knowledge with the community by writing and speaking, contributing to open source and organizing meetups and events.\nMajid is the author of \"Progressive web app with Angular\" book by Apress and \"Progressive Web Apps\" video course by PacktPub and Udemy. He is (co)organizer of a few mobile and web meetups in Norway as well as Nordic conferences for mobile and Angular, Mobile Era and ngVikings.\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

The main hurdle for web developers coming to mobile development (native apps with React native or PWAs) is handling offline capabilities.\n\nJosh speaks firsthand about this learning curve, the pitfalls and realisations of doing this in production apps. As an architect developer at Theodo, he has seen developers struggle with this mindset switch on their projects over the past 2 years, and wants to share their learnings!\n\nJosh speaks about:\n- Optimistic UX updating\n- Data persistence between app/server\n- Offline mode (request queuing)\n- Reconciling updates after this\"\n\n \nSubscribe to our channel to see more React (Native) talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFrt8oKNYXGspSlX9u6uXw/",

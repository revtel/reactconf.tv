        "description": "ReactNext 2018\nwww.react-next.com\n@reactnext\n\nThe main premise of modern reactive applications is that they provide high-performance out of the box, making the user experience feel blazingly fast. Yet, there’s a limit to the magic that even React can pull off. There are times we need to help it, and often we might actually hurt the performance of our applications.\n\nIn this talk I will do a live demo of investigating and resolving performance issues such as how immutable state' can actually adversely affect performance or how inefficient selectors can lead to components unnecessarily re-rendering. Using the Chrome Dev Tools and other profiling tools provided by React itself, we will discover how to find what's causing slowdowns. Then we'll go through the best practices needed to make our app blazing fast again.\n\nYoav Niran, Senior Frontend Developer @ Cloudinary\nI’m passionate about Technology, Software Engineering, Basketball and all things Science and Sci-Fi. I've been writing code for many years with a focus on web and front-end in particular. These days, I split my time between my two passions: writing code and writing my first sci-fi novel.",

A dream that can turn into a nightmare as the codebase grows, matures and finally becomes unmanageable. \n\nReact is based on the concept of components. The idea is to compose your application of independent building blocks that you can easily reuse or replace with better ones. If you embrace this idea, you can keep your platform tidy and maintainable. If you don’t – well, you can write React spaghetti code just as easily as you can write jQuery spaghetti code. \n\nPatrick talks about his team’s constant effort to “componentize all the things”, to find best practices, strategies and patterns to constantly improve the code base.

        "description": "ReactNext 2018\nwww.react-next.com\n@reactnext\n\nThe open-source React community has produced some amazing 3rd-party libraries that make React development as powerful as it is. But what does it take to create a \"beautiful abstraction\", a library that hides a lot of complexity into a simple API? To answer this, I took a journey into the source code of 18 different React libraries, including of course the \"big ones\" like Redux, React Router, etc.\n\nIn this talk we'll examine the patterns that these libraries share, and how you can apply them your own React Components\n\nYonatan Mevorach, Web Developer @ Wix.com\nI am a Web Developer with an expertise in frontend technologies, and my passion is creating high-end, quality, beautiful and performant web applications.

        "description": "ReactNext 2018\nwww.react-next.com\n@reactnext\n\nImmer is a tiny package that allows you to work with immutable data structures with unprecedented ease. It doesn't require learning new data structures or update APIs, but instead creates a temporarily shadow tree which can be modified using the standard JavaScript APIs. The shadow tree will be used to generate your next immutable state tree. This shadow tree is maintained using Proxies.\n\nProxies are an exotic javascript feature that is nowadays available in all modern browsers. What are they, how do they work and why should you (not) use them?\n\nJoin this talk to learn more about Proxies, or about how to deal with immutability data structures with a better DX as was ever possible so far. Brace yourself; your reducers will become twice as short without giving up on any of the semantic constraints.\n\nSlides for the talk: (including source code of the demos): http://immer-react-next-2018.surge.sh\n\n\nMichel Weststrate - Mendix, Tech Lead & OSS Evangelist\nTech Lead and Open Source evangelist at Mendix.

But it turns out there are a couple of other patterns that are useful when building larger react applications. \n\nThis talk covers topics like how to inject services into your component tree, how to deal with different designs for different screen sizes when media queries just don't cut it, how to really keep presentation components clean and simple and where to put the complicated bits. It also touches on some of the dark arts of what's really possible with JSX.\n\nRobert Herbst - GoDaddy, SDE IV\nRobert is a lover of all things code related and passionate about sharing \"Aha!\" moments he experiences. He's walked a winding path through the software world—including Delphi, dotnet, Ruby, Haskell and a developing interest in Rust and Elixir—but has most recently been involved with frontend development of the React and Javascript flavour and has some insights and learnings to share that come from working on large scale frontend applications in the enterprise space.

In the last couple of years our team built a huge production app in react native.\n\nIn this talk I’ll go over some of our lessons learned in regards of react native performance and how to improve your app’s performance subsequently.\n\nHi I'm Ofir, an R&D manager at WIX.com. In the last few years I've worked a lot with react and angular and developed wix's dashboard from scratch. Over the last two years I’ve been leading the Wix CRM Mobile team, writing wix’s mobile app in react native and now I'm leading the Wix Chat group. I'm also a mentor at WIX Academy (WIX's training program) and I love speaking about software in all of its forms. Besides programming, I'm an adrenaline enthusiastic.

As great as they are, having multiple teams working on a single, shared codebase is still a difficult task. It forces you to deal with issues such as accumulating tech debt, code ownership, and generally keeping everyone from stepping on each other’s toes.\n\nThe world of backend development has already moved from monolithing, single-process deployments to using microservices as the go-to architecture for development at scale.\n\nIn this session we will explore microservices design patterns, and learn how you can apply them to a React app, in order to scale the development of the app to multiple teams.\n\nItay Maoz  - Tech Lead @ Soluto\nFor the past three years I have worked at Soluto as a senior software engineer, and as a tech lead.

        "description": "www.react-next.com\n@reactnext\n\nReact has exploded in popularity. But it’s only a UI library, not a full-fledged framework like Angular, Ember or [insert latest JS framework]. We need to create our own “framework” by picking from the plethora of libraries in the React ecosystem. But which ones should we choose? Or better yet, which ones do we actually need? Do we need a Redux? What about handling styling, testing and routing, etc? How does it all come together?!!?!\n\nLet’s walk through the tools and helper libraries that surround React. By the end of the session, you’ll have a solid understanding of the ecosystem and know which libraries you should prioritize learning first in order to confidently build your own React-based stack.\n\nBen Ilegbodu - Eventbrite, Principal Frontend Engineer\nBen is a Christian, husband and father of 2 girls, with a dozen years of experience developing user interfaces for the Web. He currently is a Principal Frontend Engineer at Eventbrite on the Frontend Platform team, focused on improving their React-based design system and frontend infrastructure. Ben also enjoys playing basketball, DIY, watching movies, and tweeting (@benmvp) / blogging (benmvp.com) about his experiences with new web technologies.",

In this talk, we will look at the internals of React Native, and how code written in JavaScript can power a fully native mobile application. We will look at the various parts of the system like the bridge, the UI manager and the plugins. We will also touch upon the rendering process and compare it to React's rendering on the web. We will look at some of the new and exciting improvements powered by Fiber, and talk about the the interesting experiments and upcoming features.\n\nThis talk stems from my experiences as a web-developer newbie on the React Native team, and is an attempt to document my journey in comprehending the code base. At the end of the talk, the attendees will not only be able to build React Native apps, but also understands how it all works together.\n\nParashuram N - Software Engineer, Facebook\nParashuram is a software engineer at Facebook, working on the React Native core team.
